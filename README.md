# VisionEval-Docs

Documentation for the VisionEval project

`user_guide` contains Bookdown-formatted documentation for all aspects of the VisionEval project.

`docs` contains the Bookdown-generated output from building the `user_guide`. A workflow moves
this folder over to the `docs` subfolder in the trunk (master) branch of
[VisionEval.org](https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval.org)

The rendered version of the docs are synced to the GitHub pages site and published at
https://VisionEval.github.io/docs/
