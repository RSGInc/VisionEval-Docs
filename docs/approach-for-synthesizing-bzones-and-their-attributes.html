<li>The user provides inputs on:<br>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Azone proportional split of dwelling units by location type (metropolitan, town and rural)</li>
<li>Azone proportional split of workers by job site location types (for example, proportions of rural residents in the Azone who work in rural locations, town locations, or the metropolitan area)</li>
<li>Marea proportional split of Marea employment among Azones</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Total activity – numbers of households and jobs – will determine the number of SimBzones in the Azone. SimBzones will have equal amounts of activity and unequal areas since activity density will vary among SimBzones. An appropriate average SimBzone activity value will be determined through evaluation of the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/smart-location-mapping#SLD">EPA Smart Location Database (SLD)</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Models will be applied to select a destination accessibility value for each Bzone. For metropolitan type development, the model will create a distribution of destination accessibility values that is consistent with the overall activity density in the metropolitan area. Random sampling from the distribution will be used to assign destination accessibility values to metropolitan SimBzones. Models will also be developed for town and rural types, but more investigation is needed in order to determine their form.</p></li>
<li><p>Activity density of each SimBzones will be determined as a function of the destination accessibility of each zone (because destination accessibility is a measure of activity density at a larger geographic scale). A model will be estimated from the SLD which creates a distribution of zone densities as a function of destination accessibility. An adjustment process, such as an iterative proportional fitting process (IPF), will be used to adjust densities and destination accessibilities so that the overall activity density of all the zones in a metropolitan area is equal to the input value</p></li>
<li><p>Further subdivision of the metropolitan area into area types will be done as a function of the destination accessibility and activity density of each zone. Four such area types are proposed: urban core, close in community, and suburban/town, low density/rural. The final typology and the relationship of area types to destination accessibility and activity density will be developed through examination of the SLD dataset. It is envisioned that area types will be defined as fuzzy sets rather than crisp sets. Although some SimBzones may be wholly one type, many SimBzones will have degrees of membership in several types. Using fuzzy sets is a more realistic recognition of the nature of area types and avoids aberrations resulting from threshold effects.</p></li>
<li><p>The total activity in each SimBzone is split into households and jobs using a model which relates zonal mixing to destination accessibility, activity density, and area type. This model will be specified and estimated based on investigations using the SLD data. It is anticipated that the model will produce distributions of activity splits from which values will be drawn. IPF or some other adjustment process will be used to adjust values so that the aggregation of the splits for all the SimBzones in an Azone is consistent with the Azone inputs. This model will also need to specify the split of land area between households and jobs.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the number of households is determined for each SimBzone, the split of dwelling units by housing type (single family, multifamily) as a function of activity density. The SLD and census data will be used to develop this model. IPF is be used to fit the distribution of SimBzone values to Azone level control totals. This will allow users to specify Azone ratios as policy inputs.</p></li>
<li><p>A variant of the VE-RSPM housing model is applied to assign households to housing types and to Bzones. One thing to be worked out is whether the allocation to SimBzones considers household income or not. In VE-RSPM, relative Bzone income distributions are input and these are used in the process of allocating households to Bzones. This enables VE-State users to model general relationships of income to parts of the metropolitan area (e.g., the effect of gentrification in the urban core).</p></li>
<li><p>Jobs in each SimBzone will be split into numbers of retail, service, and other jobs. The approach for doing this is yet to be determined. SimBzone splits will be constrained so that they total to Azone splits that are inputs. The model will probably be a function of the destination accessibility, employment density, and mixing of households and employment in the SimBzone. The SLD data will be used to develop and estimate this model. Thought will be given as to whether there should be control totals on the mix for a metropolitan area. If so, IPF or some other adjustment process would need to be used to match the totals.</p></li>
<li><p>Workers will be assigned to SimBzone job sites. How this is done is yet to be determined. It is proposed that an agile development approach be used where the first iteration of the model will be a random assignment of workers to job sites. Other extensions that could be considered if there is time/budget investigation could be done using LEHD data and SLD data to look for relationships between worker residence by area type and worker job site by area type. Relative income could also be considered.</p></li>
<li><p>Once numbers of households and numbers of jobs by type are assigned to SimBzones, all the remaining density and diversity measures can be calculated.</p></li>
<li><p>The distance to transit measure is modeled for metropolitan SimBzones as a function of the metropolitan-level transit supply measure and the SimBzone attributes for destination</p></li>
<li><p>Development type (e.g., residential, employment, mixed, transit-oriented development, greenfield), are assigned to SimBzones based on the density, diversity, and distance to transit measures. These development types, like the area types may be fuzzy sets. The SLD is used to create the development type specifications. The design will enable model users to input Marea goals for the proportional split of development types. The model will adjust the allocation of development types consistent with the goals but constrained to plausible levels.</p></li>
<li><p>Network design measures used by the VE-RSPM multi-modal travel model (e.g., multi-modal network density, pedestrian network density) will be applied based on inputs related to area and development type. The SLD will be used to identify ranges of values by area and development type. Users will specify in inputs goals relative to these ranges by Azone, development type and area type.</p></li>
<li><p>The parking pricing, travel demand management, and car service inputs is specified by Azone, area type, and development type. These will then be translated to the SimBzone based on the SimBzone area type and development type. After that is done, the <code>AssignDemandManagement</code>, <code>AssignParkingRestrictions</code>, and <code>AssignCarSvcAvailability</code> modules can run as they currently do. Thought will be given as to how to simplify inputs so that users are not required to provide inputs for every combination of Azone, area type and development type.</p></li>
