<p>One of the strengths of VisionEval is the rich detail on individual households. This allows for household specific policies, travel behavior can respond to specific household costs and attributes, and outputs can be mined for differences by population groups. The approach of building on a synthesized population borrows from the state of the practice in activity-based travel demand models.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Watch a <a href="https://youtu.be/-ylFbyLfhbw?t=5371">short video</a> on household synthesis</p>
</blockquote>
<p>VisionEval creates simulated households in each AZone from user-supplied projections of persons by <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">age group</span></a> and average <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">per capita income</span></a>. Each simulated household has the characteristics of the number of persons in each of 6 age groups, number of workers in each of 5 age groups, <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">lifecycle category</span></a>, and household income. The simulated households are assigned a <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">dwelling unit</span></a> type (single family or multi-family) using a model that is sensitive to the household characteristics and the number of units of each type assigned to the Azone (based on user inputs). Each simulated household is assigned to a BZone based on the number of dwelling units of their assigned type in each Bzone and the household’s income compared to the relative income distribution by BZone. Separately, BZones are attributed with employment and land use attributes (<a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">location type</span></a>, <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">built form ‘D’ values</span></a>, <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">urban mixed use</span></a>, and <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">employment by type</span></a>). Household members who are workers are assigned a BZone work location as a function of the distribution of jobs in the model area. Each home and work location is tied to a specific Bzone with its associated attributes.</p>
<p>Policies are added to each household as a function of their home and work Bzones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parking restrictions (work and non-work)</li>
<li>
<a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">Travel demand management</span></a> (TDM) programs (home and work-based)</li>

<span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Synthesize households<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#synthesize-households"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Household synthesis is carried out in several steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<em>Create customized PUMS dataset</em>: This is done prior to setting up a model in VisionEval. A household dataset is prepared from <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">Census PUMS</span></a> data for the modeled region. The default data included with VisionEval is for Oregon. PUMS data for other regions may be used instead, rebuilding the package to reflect Census households for the region of interest.</li>
<li>
<em>Create Households</em>: The identified types of PUMS households are expanded to meet user control totals and other demographic inputs. <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">Census PUMS</span></a> data are used define probabilities that a person by <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">age group</span></a> would be found in each of hundreds of household types. A matrix balancing process is used to allocate persons by age to each of the PUMS household types in a way that matches input control totals and optional constraints. The sampled households are expanded to meet user control totals and other demographic inputs.</li>
<li>
<em>Predict Workers</em>: The number of workers by <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">age group</span></a> within each simulated household is predicted using <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">Census PUMS</span></a> probabilities. The user may optionally specify changes in employment rates by age group and Azone to simulate changes in labor force participation over time and/or differences in employment rates by location.</li>
<li>
<em>Assign LifeCyle</em>: Categorizes households are categorized by six <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">lifecycle</span></a> categories given the household age mix and employment status.</li>
<li>
<em>Predict Income</em>: The annual income for each simulated household is predicted as a function of the household’s worker count by age group, the average <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">per capita income</span></a> where the household resides (AZone), and interactions between neighborhood income and age (all and seniors). The models are estimated with <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">Census PUMS</span></a> data.</li>
</ol>

<span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Household drivers and autos<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#household-drivers-and-autos"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The number of drivers and autos in each household are calculated in two steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<em>Assign Drivers</em>: Drivers by <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">age group</span></a> are assigned to each household as a function of the numbers of persons and workers by age group, the household income, land use characteristics, and transit availability. <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">Metropolitan areas</span></a> are also sensitive to transit service level and urban <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">mixed use</span></a> indicators at the home location. Optional restriction on drivers by age group can be used in calibration or to address trends such as lower millennial <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">licensure rate</span></a>s.</li>
<li>
<em>Assign Vehicle Ownership</em>: The number of vehicles owned or leased by each household are determined as a function of household characteristics, land use characteristics, and transportation system characteristics. Households in <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">metropolitan areas</span></a> are also sensitive to <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">transit service level</span></a> and <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">urban mixed use</span></a> indicators at the home location. The model first predicts zero-auto households and then the number of vehicles owned (up to 6), if any.</li>

<span class="header-section-number">3.1.3</span> Land use attributes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#land-use-attributes"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>

<p>Two steps are required to add land use attributes to the synthetic population:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<em>Calculate 4D Measures</em>: Several land use <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">5D built form measures</span></a> are calculated for each Bzone. The <code>density</code>, <code>diversity</code>, and <code>destination</code> accessibilities are based on Bzone population, employment, dwelling units, and <code>developable land area</code> inputs. The <code>design</code> variable is a user input.</li>
<li>
<em>Calculate Urban Mixed Use Measure</em>: An <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">urban mixed</span></a> measure for the household is calculated based on population density of the home Bzone and <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">dwelling unit type</span></a>. The model is based on 2001 NHTS data. The model iterates to match an optional input target on the share of households to locate in <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">urban mixed-use</span></a> areas.</li>

<p>Several land use attributes are added to each household:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<em>Assign Location Types</em>: Households are assigned to land use <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">location types</span></a> – urban, town, or rural – by random allocation based on the household’s <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">dwelling unit type</span></a> and input proportions on the mix of dwelling types in its enclosing Bzone.</li>

A worker table is developed and each worker is assigned to a work Bzone. The assignment essentially uses a gravity-type model with tabulations of workers and jobs by Bzone (marginal controls) and distance between residence and employment Bzones (IPF seed, inverse of straight-line distances between home and all work Bzone centroids).</li>

<p>Several assumptions about parking, demand management, and mobility services can also be coded:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/gregorbj/Archive-VisionEval/blob/develop/api/VE_Training_March_13-14_2019/VE_Training.md#46-assignparkingrestrictions-module"><em>Assign Parking Restrictions</em></a>: Households are assigned specific <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">parking restrictions</span></a> and fees for their residence, workplace(s), and other places they are likely to visit based on parking inputs by BZone (within Bzones coded as within metropolitan areas [Marea] only).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Residential Parking Restrictions &amp; Fees</em>: The number of free parking spaces available at the household’s residence is set based on input value that identify the average residential parking spaces by dwelling type in each Bzone. For household vehicles that cannot be parked in a free space a residential parking cost (part of auto ownership costs) is identified as a function of input parking rates for the home Bzone (if any).</li>
<li>
<em>Employer Parking and Fees</em>: Which workers pay for parking is set by inputs that define the proportion of workers facing parking fees in each Bzone. Whether their payment is part of a <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">cash out/buy back</span></a> program is similarly set by input proportions by Bzone and associated fees set by input parking rates for the work Bzone.</li>
<li>
<em>Non-work Parking Fees:</em> The cost of parking for other activities such as shopping is estimated as the likelihood that a household would visit each Bzone and the parking fee in that Bzone. The likelihood is calculated with a gravity-type model, given the relative amount of activity in the Bzone (numbers of households by Bzone and the scaled retail and service job attractions by Bzone as marginals) and the proximity to each destination (inverse distance matrix from home Bzone seed matrix). The average daily parking cost is a weighted average of the fee faced in each destination bzone and the likelihood of visiting that Bzone.</li>

A simple percentage reduction in household VMT is applied based on the household’s participation in one or more of these program (maximum of multiple program participation, to avoid double-counting). Worker reductions are only applied to that worker’s work travel portion of overall household VMT, and summed if multiple workers in the household participate in such programs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Watch a <a href="https://youtu.be/-ylFbyLfhbw?t=5927">video overview</a> of the Household Multimodal Travel module</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Travel of various modes by households (vehicle, transit, bike, and walk modes) is estimated as a simple function of the rich demographic and land use attributes of the household. In <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">metropolitan areas</span></a> travel is also influenced by inputs on transport supply on a per capita basis, such as available <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">roadway capacity</span></a> and <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:red">bus-equivalent transit service</span></a> levels. Transit, bike, and walk trips are also influenced by household VMT (i.e. if household VMT decreases, trips by these modes increase, and vise verse). Traditional travel models incorporate behavioral dynamics in choice models to build tours and trips for each synthetic person. VisionEval, by contrast, uses simple regression equations that directly estimate average per capita trips and miles by mode, linked by average trip lengths.</p>
<p>After adjusting VMT for household budget limitations it is further adjusted for household participation in TDM programs (home &amp; work-based) and <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">short-trip SOV diversion</span></a> before calculating household trips for all modes. The household’s bike miles are also adjusted to reflect SOV diversion input.</p>
<p>The following sections describe each module, which are implemented in sequence:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The household’s daily VMT is calculated without household budget adjustments</li>
<li>The household’s vehicle operating costs are calculated</li>
<li>The household’s vehicle operating cost budget is calculated and daily VMT is adjusted to fit within the budget if necessary</li>
<li>Daily VMT reductions due to TDM measures and short-trip SOV diversions are calculated and applied</li>
<li>Vehicle and non-vehicular (AltMode) trips are calculated for each household</li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<em>Assign Transit Service</em>: Transit service levels are input for each <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">metropolitan areas</span></a> and neighborhood (Bzone).

A Bzone-level <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:red">Transit D</span></a> attribute defines access to transit (not yet work access) for each household based on inputs on relative transit accessibility. Using factors derived from the National Transit Database (NTD), input annual transit revenue miles for each of the eight transit modes are converted to <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">bus-equivalent miles</span></a> by three <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">transit vehicle types</span></a> (van, bus, and rail).

<em>Calculate Household Daily VMT (Dvmt)</em>: Household average daily vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is estimated as a function of household characteristics(income, workers, children, drivers), vehicle ownership, and attributes of the neighborhood (population density) and metropolitan area (<a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">urban mixed-use</span></a>, <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">transit service level</span></a>, freeway lane-miles) where the household resides. It also calculates household VMT percentiles which are used by other modules to calculate whether a household is likely to own an electric vehicle (EV) and to calculate the proportions of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) VMT powered by electricity. These values are derived from the 2001 <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">NHTS</span></a> data.</li>
<li>
<em>CalculateVehicleTrips</em>: This module calculates average daily vehicle trips for households consistent with the household VMT. Average length of household vehicle trips is estimated as a function of household characteristics (drivers/non-driers, income), vehicle ownership (<a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">auto sufficiency</span></a>), and attributes of the neighborhood (population density) and <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">metropolitan area</span></a> (<a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">urban mixed-use</span></a>, freeway lane-miles) where the household resides, and interactions among these variables. The average trip length is divided into the average household VMT to get an estimate of average number of daily vehicle trips.</li>
<li>
<em>Calculate AltMode Trips</em>: This module calculates household transit trips, walk trips, and bike trips. The models are sensitive to household VMT so they are run after all household VMT adjustments (e.g., to account for cost on household VMT) are made. Twelve models estimate trips for the three modes in metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas, in two steps each. The first step determines whether a household has any AltMode trips and the second part determines the number of trips. All of the models include terms for household characteristics (size, income, age mix) and the household’s overall VMT. Neighborhood factors (population density) factors into all but the bike trip models. For households in metropolitan areas <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">transit service level</span></a> has an impact as well, with transit ridership also sensitive to when residents live in <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">urban mixed-use</span></a> neighborhoods.</li>

</h3>
<p>Household single-occupant vehicle (SOV) travel is reduced to achieve bike and micro-transportation input policy goals, i.e., for diverting a portion of SOV travel within a 20-mile tour distance (round trip distance). This allows evaluating the potential for light-weight vehicles (e.g. bicycles, electric bikes, electric scooters) and infrastructure to support their use, in reducing SOV travel. First, the amount of the household’s VMT that occurs in SOV tours having round trip distances of 20 miles or less is estimated. Then the average trip length within those tours is estimated. Both models are sensitive to household characteristics(drivers, income, kids), vehicle ownership (<a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">auto sufficiency</span></a>), and attributes of the neighborhood (population density, dwelling type) and <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">metropolitan area</span></a> (<a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">urban mixed-use</span></a>, freeway lane-miles) where the household resides, and the household’s overall VMT.</p>
<p>The diversion of these short trips is assumed to only apply in urban and town <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">location types</span></a>. The VMT reductions are allocated to households as a function of the household’s SOV VMT and (the inverse of) SOV trip length. In other words, it is assumed that households having more qualifying SOV travel and households having shorter SOV trips will be more likely to divert SOV travel to bicycle-like modes. The estimates of the household’s share of diverted VMT, average trip length of diverted VMT are applied elsewhere to reduce DMVT and increase bike trips. Zero vehicle households are not allowed to divert SOV travel. <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">Census PUMS</span></a> data is used to estimate the models.</p>

<p>The <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">powertrains</span></a>, fuels, and associated emissions datasets for all modeled <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">vehicle groups</span></a> are among the most complex inputs used in VisionEval. Default datasets are included in the VisionEval installer to simplify this for the user. The user can use these defaults or develop their own data that matches the VisionEval input requirements. It is anticipated that different datasets will be developed by users that can be shared with the VisionEval community. For example, one package may represent a base scenario of federal vehicle, fuel, and emission standards, while another package represents the California zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) rules and low carbon fuel for the home location’s <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">CarService</span></a>.</p>
<p>The model looks in household vehicle sales tables indexed by <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">vehicle type</span></a> and age to determine the probability of each powertrain in that sales year, along with its associated fuel efficiency and other attributes. Each household vehicle is assigned attributes consistent with these probabilities. In some cases electric vehicles (EVs) are replaced by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) if household VMT and residential charging limitations exist.</p>
<p>The <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">powertrain</span></a> mix of non-household vehicle groups – car service, commercial service, transit, and heavy trucks – is applied to VMT (rather than individual vehicles) in the scenario year (rather than sales year). There is some input adjustment for average vehicle age and commercial <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">vehicle type</span></a> share.</p>
<p>Fuels for each vehicle groups can rely on the package defaults, or use one of two input options. The user can either provide a composite <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">carbon intensity</span></a> representing all gallons of fuel used for that vehicle group, or provide fuel mix shares (base fuel mix, biofuel blend proportions), combined with package default lifecycle (well-to-wheels) carbon intensity for the individual fuels. The resulting carbon intensity per gallon are applied to gallons generated from VMT and vehicle fuel efficiency assumptions. Adjustments to fuel efficiency due to reduced speeds due to congestion as well as ITS operational programs (e.g., <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">speed smoothing</span></a>) and <a href="lexicon.html#lexicon"><span style="color:green">EcoDrive</span></a> programs.</p>

<p>Note that individual vehicles are modeled for households, based on sales year default datasets and age of the owned vehicle. Other groups’ vehicle and fuel attributes apply to VMT in the scenario modeled year. As a result, PHEVs do not exist other than household vehicles, instead PHEVs are represented as miles driven in HEVs and miles in EVs.</p>
