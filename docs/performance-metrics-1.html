<p>Using this viewer, users can select inputs of land use or policies and view their effects on model outputs, and the process can also be reversed, allowing users to choose desired outcomes and view the policy scenarios that reflect those outcomes.
Instructions for using the viewer are built in to the page itself. To access a condensed version of the instructions, click on the Quick Start button at the top of the page.</p>
<p>To understand more detail on the available categories of inputs and their levels as well as more detailed descriptions of the model output shown in the bar charts you can click on Detailed Instructions button</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img align="center" width="1100" border="1" src="https://github.com/visioneval/VisionEval-Docs/blob/master/tutorials/verspm/images/detailed.PNG"></div>
<p>To see which policy choices and land use inputs result in desired outcomes, select a range of values within one outcome. In this case, the low end of the DVMT per capita has been chosen:</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img align="center" width="1100" border="1" src="https://github.com/visioneval/VisionEval-Docs/blob/master/tutorials/verspm/images/DVMT_per_capita.PNG"></div>
<p>As the outcome is selected, the bar graphs and the data table at the bottom (not shown) update to show only the scenarios resulting in the selected outcome.
For instance, In this case, the low end of DVMT per capita are associated with the most increase in fuel price or more public transit and parking costs for community design.</p>
<p>It is also possible to select inputs to view the associated outcomes. To do so, simply click on the bar corresponding to the desired scenario input. In this case (below) the scenario with highest fuel price is selected to view the impacts on outcome variables
Here, DVMT per capita and annual fuel cost digrams shift to the left as expected since less people are expected to drive in this scenario</p>
