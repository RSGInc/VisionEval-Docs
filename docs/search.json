One emerging school thought land use planning consider land uses terms place types instead simply residential commercial high density compared low density. place type refers characteristics developed area including types uses included, mix uses, density intensity uses.initial typology system organize place types can traced Smart Growth Transect, contained six zones original configuration including:Rural PreserveRural ReserveEdgeGeneralCenterCoreThis approach classifying place types refined Caltrans Smart Mobility defined following seven place types including:Urban CentersClose-Compact CommunitiesCompact CommunitiesSuburban CommunitiesRural Agricultural LandsProtected LandsSpecial Use AreasSeveral place type categories provided additional options Close-Compact Communities three sub-definitions including Close--Centers, Close-Corridors, Close-Neighborhoods.alternative view place types provided Reconnecting America, developed performance based place type approach describing areas proximate transit stations. Station areas vary terms relative focus residential units, employees mix two. Station areas also characterized relative intensity well shown .PERFORMANCE BASED TYPOLOGY TRANSIT STATION AREASThe approach employed place types RPAT therefore amalgam approaches, terminology borrowed Smart Growth Transect Caltrans Smart Mobility Study, relative performance place type taken Reconnecting America approach applied region instead transit station sites.Four general area types defined RPAT including:Urban Core high-density mixed-use places high jobs-housing ratios, well connected streets high levels pedestrian activities. anticipated many regions, Urban Core traditional downtown area likely one.Close-Community areas located near Urban Cores consist primarily housing scattered mixed-use centers arterial corridors. Housing varied terms density type. Transit available primary focus commute trips. areas may classified residents suburban considered close-communities given adjacency Downtown therefore higher levels regional accessibility.Suburban place type anticipated represent majority development within regions. communities characterized low level integration housing jobs, retail, services, poorly connected street networks, low levels transit service, large amounts surface parking, limited walk ability.Rural place type defined settlements widely spaced towns separated firms, vineyards, orchards, grazing lands. areas characterized widely dispersed residential uses, little transit service, limited pedestrian facilities.definition place types allowed use development types within Urban Core, Close-Community, Suburban area types including:Residential includes place types predominantly residential character limited employment retail opportunities. Examples development type might include typical Suburban Residential areas Downtown primarily residential well. anticipated development type may found area types except rural.Employment includes areas focused employment limited retail residential. example might include Suburban Office Complex large cluster office buildings within Close-Community Urban Core. residential development type, anticipated type use found place types except rural.Mixed-Use areas within region mix residential, employment, retail uses. development type can found Suburban place type, commonly found close-community urban core place type. Downtown areas retained residential population complement employment examples development type.Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) similar development types applied area types except Rural areas since thought highly unlikely rural TOD developed. TOD development type characterized greater access transit area types.
