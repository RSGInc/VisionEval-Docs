How to Use this Guide", " VisionEval User Guide Last updated 2022-03-07 Welcome This guide contains documentation for users and developers of the VisionEval modeling system. About VisionEval VisionEval is a collaborative project to build a family of strategic tools for performance-based transportation planning into a single open-source programming framework. Strategic tools are designed to evaluate many alternative futures and policies to help state and metropolitan area governments address pressing issues, despite uncertainty. Why Use VisionEval? Strategic planning is becoming increasingly important as a means to help state and metropolitan area governments select policies and actions to address pressing issues that are fraught with uncertainty. More specifically, Federal direction has challenged state, regional, and local transportation agencies with measuring the outcomes of decisions through performance-based planning, including considering how transportation solutions may impact future goals such as sustainability, health, and mobility. Further complicating matters, plans need to be resilient to changing transportation and land use trends and the implications of emerging technologies and constraints. VisionEval is an open source common framework building on the successful GreenSTEP family of strategic planning tools that is intended to address these needs. VisionEval merges this family of tools into an open-source project with a supporting community forum of partner agencies and others sharing in its use and enhancement. The goal is to support a broad array of potential tool uses and enable pooled enhancements expanding the types of outcomes measured or refine the specificity of transportation and land use solutions considered. The work to date draws from successful past and interested future users nationally, who will both define the policy needs and uses of these tools, and set their direction moving forward.

This Concepts Primer provides a quick introduction approach to the unique features and applications of VisionEval. It reviews the main model components and key concepts at a high level, to assist new users in understanding concepts they will apply as they set up scenarios, develop inputs and evaluate outputs. Links to more detailed documentation will allow the reader to delve further into each topic, as they choose. 1.1.1 What can I do with VisionEval? Structurally, VisionEval may be described as a disaggregate demand/aggregate supply model. That is, it combines rich demographic and socioeconomic detail from a synthetic population with aggregate treatments of travel (multi-modal VMT and congestion without explicit trips, or transport networks). The implication of the aggregate supply model is that VisionEval cannot be used to evaluate performance of specific projects or corridors. What VisionEval can do, and even makes especially simple, is to evaluate large numbers of scenarios and explore how combinations of alternative future conditions might affect performance measures. Travel demand models, whether built using traditional trip-based or more contemporary activity-based techniques, sacrifice flexibility for network detail. It is difficult in such models to capture novel behaviors such as an increased propensity to use inexpensive ride-hailing services, or to express shifts in vehicle ownership and occupancy that may be influenced by multiple factors some of which have not yet been observed. Yet these potential shifts are often very important for assessing the potential of pricing, investment strategies or other policy priorities. VisionEval also makes it relatively simple to explore risks and opportunities that may eventually be realized as new transportation options mature. VisionEval wont help us determine if a particular highway segment should be built or upgraded, or what kind of transit service improvements should be extended into new areas. But it can help us look at the market for new technologies, and explore future scenarios that are based both on changed circumstances (altered demographics, increased congestion, or alternate road pricing strategies) as well as on changed behaviors (including behaviors that might happen, but that we have not yet observed because the key enabling technologies are too early in their deployment). VisionEval results can be explored in detail by market segment, asking questions about how benefits might be distributed regionally, and what overall system performance might look like. Ultimately, VisionEval is a system for asking a very broad range of what if questions about how the transportation system might perform, and how its benefits and costs might be distributed over the community. It can efficiently process hundreds of scenarios looking at many different types of interventions, alternative policies, and hypothetical future conditions and travel behaviors. The results can inform strategic questions, helping decision makers answer questions such as What are our options for achieving this performance result? or What are our risks if new transportation technologies develop in these different ways? Using VisionEval to answer such questions does not make other types of modeling obsolete (such as travel demand models or corridor microsimulations). Instead, it helps to determine what is worth the effort to code into these more detailed models, and also to explore and document novel assumptions about the future that may require extra effort to implement, and that would be prohibitively expensive to explore through traditional planning models. 1.1.2 Strengths and limitations VisionEval operates at broad geographic levels and without explicit network representations to enable very fast analyses across scores of different assumptions and inputs. It is especially well suited for quickly evaluating several different combinations of policies or assessing the range of impacts when uncertainty exists in several key inputs. Because much of the travel behavior is asserted based on observed travel patterns the latter can be changed to reflect expected changes due to new technologies, services, and expected changes in behavior over time. Thus, VisionEval is better suited than traditional travel modeling approaches for certain pursuits: Screening a wide range of policy actions, especially in the face of uncertainties where ranges of expected responses or effects must be considered Resilience testing under uncertainties (e.g., population growth, household size, fuel prices) Directly comparing and contrasting broad ranges or combinations of policies (e.g., ITS, transit service, active transport, demand management) Analysis of broad policy or technology changes (e.g., carbon taxes, low-carbon fuels) Evaluating fuel consumption, particulate emissions, and greenhouse gas emissions impacts of proposed policies However, VisionEval is not well suited for detailed geographic analyses, to include the effects of congestion on individual trips or tours. Thus, examining the effects of localized land use (e.g.Â parcel or block) or network assumptions cannot be carried out using VisionEval. Improvements in network capacity, efficiency, or safety can only be indirectly incorporated in VisionEval. 1.1.3 VisionEval geographies Traditional travel forecasting models divide a study area into thousands of traffic analysis zones in order to facilitate highly granular spatial analyses. This allows trip (tour segment) origins and destinations to enter and exit a detailed representation of the multimodal transportation network in order to study network flows, congestion, and efficiency outcomes. VisionEval operates at a much broader spatial scale, using several levels of geography: A region defines the entire area covered by the VisionEval analyses Azones are large areas such as cities, counties, or Census Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) Bzones are subdivisions of Azones that represent neighborhoods, Census tracts or block groups, or other relatively homogenous areas Metropolitan areas (Marea) are defined as groups of Azones that define them The location type of each household is also coded as urban, town, or rural areas. A place type is also defined in terms of urban density and its mix of jobs and housing. Both are usually defined for each Bzone used in the model. Watch a video presentation with more information about VisionEval geographies 1.1.4 Performance metrics The following table summarizes many of the possible performance metrics that can be summarized at the region level. The ability to easily export the data enables the analyst to construct new or different performance measures easily. Mobility Daily VMT per capita Annual walk trips per capita Daily Bike trips per capita Economy Annual all vehicle delay per capita (hours) Daily household parking costs Annual household vehicle operating cost (fuel, taxes, parking) Annual household [auto ownership costs][auto_own_cost] (depreciation, vehicle maintenance, tires, finance charge, insurance, registration) Land Use Number or percent of residents living in mixed use areas Number of dwelling by housing type (e.g., single family [SF], multi-family [MF]) Environmental Annual greenhouse gas emissions per capita Household vehicle greenhouse gas/mile Commercial vehicle greenhouse gas/mile Transit vehicle greenhouse gas/mile Energy Annual per capita fuel consumption for all vehicles (gallons) Average fuel efficiency (net miles per gallon) for all vehicles Annual external social costs per households (total/percent paid) 1.2 Typical applications VisionEval can be used to inform planning in several different realms, as described in the following sections. 1.2.1 Strategic modeling VisionEval is a strategic modeling system. It differs from traditional travel demand and microsimulation models principally in that it is applied earlier in the planning process, and it is used for different purposes. Rather than examining the detailed performance of specific facilities (assessing individual projects), VisionEval estimates regional and small area performance metrics that reflect overarching policy goals such as emission reduction, regional VMT, or mode share. Traditional travel models used for planning purposes are applied to estimate outcomes under a small number of alternate input scenarios that vary land use characteristics (e.g.Â type and density of land uses), socioeconomic characteristics (e.g.Â population, ages, incomes), and/or transportation characteristics (e.g.Â road alignments, lane configurations, tolls, etc.). In these models, the response to the changed inputs is estimated based on parameters typically derived from household surveys and other related data sources: that is, the behavior in the model is presumed to be what we see today. Even though such models are often behaviorally complex (e.g., activity-based models), the effort required to assess many alternative scenarios is often prohibitive, and because such models are built using complex estimation procedures rooted in detailed data about existing behavior, it can be technically difficult or impossible to reliably encode possible future shifts in behavior, or to explore alternative possible future behaviors. VisionEval is typically set up to run many scenarios that explore a broad set of alternative policies and investment priorities that may result from a variety of possible categories of policy and project interventions, or from a range of possible future conditions (strong or weak economic growth, demographics that shift at different rates), or from uncertain deployment of new technologies such as app-based ridesharing (Transportation Network Companies or TNCs). A full application of VisionEval may examine hundreds or even thousands of permutations of inputs representing many possible future outcomes. The outputs allow planners and decision-makers to explore the outcomes of each scenario compared to the others, so they can visualize and discuss the relative impact and cross-influences, as well as the unintended consequences, of factors represented across the scenarios. VisionEval allows planners to assess alternative assumptions about uncertain phenomena such as autonomous vehicle (AV) deployment, it is a very effective tool for identifying risks and opportunities, as well as for formulating effective strategic responses to new challenges for which little current data exists or for which many outcomes are possible yet none are certain. The most interesting of the resulting strategic plans can be refined with more detailed models. Based on the strategic modeling findings, uncertainties can be confidently simplified into a smaller number of scenarios to explore in detail. Notwithstanding its typical application as a strategic model, VisionEval does allow detailed investigation of certain phenomena such as fleet composition and vehicle ownership in relation to Greenhouse Gas Analysis. It also is unique in its ability to explore budget constraints on travel. Its simulation of individual households enables it to assess policies that would be difficult or impossible to model successfully with traditional models. 1.2.2 Local policy actions VisionEval is well suited for evaluating a wide range of local policies at varying levels of geography: Demographics (Azone) Population by age (households &amp; non-institutional group quarters) Average household size and percent of single-person households Driver licensing rates (optional) Average per capita Income LandUse (Bzone) Employment by type (Total, Retail, Service) Dwelling units by type (SF, MF) Income quartiles (for allocating households to neighborhoods and Dwelling units) Share of households in Urban Mixed Use areas (optional) 5D built form measures (Design &amp; Transit) Developable area Parking pricing policies Transportation Operations Actions Road lane-miles (freeways, arterials) (Marea) Transit Service (service miles by transit mode) (Marea) Short SOV Trips Diversion (to bikes, personal electrics, etc.) (Azone) ITS Operations (Ramp metering, Incident response, (Marea) ITS speed smoothing (Freeway ATM, Art Signal optimization) (Marea) VMT covered by Drivers in Eco-Drive programs (Marea) EV Charging infrastructure (residential) (Azone) Pricing Fuel and electricity costs (Azone) Road Cost Recovery  Registration Fee, gas taxes, VMT fee (Azone) Carbon Pricing and other environmental impact fees(social cost recovery) (Region) Congestion Fees (Marea) PAYD insurance participation (Azone) Vehicle, Fuels, &amp; Emissions Electricity carbon intensity (Azone) Fuel carbon intensity (composites by vehicle group) (Region) LDV-HH percent Light Trucks (stock) (Azone) LDV-HH vehicle age average (Azone) LDV CarService, vehicle mix (stock) (Region) Transit vehicles &amp; fuels mix (Marea) LDV CommService vehicle mix, %Light Trucks (stock) (Region) Heavy truck vehicle mix (stock) (Region) 1.3 Scenario analyses A key value of VisionEval is how it facilitates running many scenarios or possible futures. In practice, the user typically starts by setting up the model with a reference scenario (i.e.Â a scenario that represents current policies and extrapolation of current trends). The model can be validated for current and past years at this point. This Reference scenario then serves as a pivot point for the development of alternative scenarios that modify one or more policy assumptions or other assumptions about the future (e.g.Â assumptions about urban area expansion, assumptions about future light-duty vehicle fleet composition). Because VisionEval models address a large number of factors that are specified by dozens of input files, and because each set of inputs could have many different values, the potential number of alternate scenarios that could be defined is probably uncountable. For this reason, the scenario generation process is simplified by defining categories of inputs that are related in how they affect behavior or are related in how policies are likely to be deployed. An example of the former would be the definition of a pricing category that groups all inputs affecting the price/cost of operating light-duty vehicles (e.g.Â fuel price, congestion price, carbon price). An example of the latter would be the definition of a land use category which in addition to including land use inputs such as development density, also includes transportation inputs that are associated with land use such as transit service frequency. For each category of inputs, several levels of change from the reference scenario assumptions are defined. Alternate scenarios can then be developed by swapping out reference scenario inputs in each category with different level inputs for the category. This is typically done in two ways: Sensitivity tests that change a single category of inputs for each run. Such tests are useful for exploring the relative effects of each category. Combinatorial tests which compose scenarios from combinations of all categories and all levels. Note that the number of combinatorial scenarios is a function of the number of categories and the number of levels in each category. For example, if inputs are grouped into 5 categories and each category has 3 levels, at total of 243 scenarios (3x3x3x3x3) would be generated by all combinations. For this reason, automated processes are typically developed to aid in the set-up and running of these scenarios, and analysis of the results. 1.4 Building blocks 1.4.1 Household synthesis and land use One of the strengths of VisionEval is the rich detail on individual households. This allows for household specific policies, travel behavior can respond to specific household costs and attributes, and outputs can be mined for differences by population groups. The approach of building on a synthesized population borrows from the state of the practice in activity-based travel demand models. Watch a short video on household synthesis VisionEval creates simulated households in each AZone from user-supplied projections of persons by age group and average per capita income. Each simulated household has the characteristics of the number of persons in each of 6 age groups, number of workers in each of 5 age groups, lifecycle category, and household income. The simulated households are assigned a dwelling unit type (single family or multi-family) using a model that is sensitive to the household characteristics and the number of units of each type assigned to the Azone (based on user inputs). Each simulated household is assigned to a BZone based on the number of dwelling units of their assigned type in each Bzone and the households income compared to the relative income distribution by BZone. Separately, BZones are attributed with employment and land use attributes (location type, built form D values, urban mixed use, and employment by type). Household members who are workers are assigned a BZone work location as a function of the distribution of jobs in the model area. Each home and work location is tied to a specific Bzone with its associated attributes. Policies are added to each household as a function of their home and work Bzones: Parking restrictions (work and non-work) Travel demand management (TDM) programs (home and work-based) CarService program availability The following sections describe each module that contributes to this concept. 1.4.1.1 Synthesize households Household synthesis is carried out in several steps: Create customized PUMS dataset: This is done prior to setting up a model in VisionEval. A household dataset is prepared from Census PUMS data for the modeled region. The default data included with VisionEval is for Oregon. PUMS data for other regions may be used instead, rebuilding the package to reflect Census households for the region of interest. Create Households: The identified types of PUMS households are expanded to meet user control totals and other demographic inputs. Census PUMS data are used define probabilities that a person by age group would be found in each of hundreds of household types. A matrix balancing process is used to allocate persons by age to each of the PUMS household types in a way that matches input control totals and optional constraints. The sampled households are expanded to meet user control totals and other demographic inputs. Predict Workers: The number of workers by age group within each simulated household is predicted using Census PUMS probabilities. The user may optionally specify changes in employment rates by age group and Azone to simulate changes in labor force participation over time and/or differences in employment rates by location. Assign LifeCyle: Categorizes households are categorized by six lifecycle categories given the household age mix and employment status. Predict Income: The annual income for each simulated household is predicted as a function of the households worker count by age group, the average per capita income where the household resides (AZone), and interactions between neighborhood income and age (all and seniors). The models are estimated with Census PUMS data. 1.4.1.2 Household drivers and autos The number of drivers and autos in each household are calculated in two steps: Assign Drivers: Drivers by age group are assigned to each household as a function of the numbers of persons and workers by age group, the household income, land use characteristics, and transit availability. Metropolitan areas are also sensitive to transit service level and urban mixed use indicators at the home location. Optional restriction on drivers by age group can be used in calibration or to address trends such as lower millennial licensure rates. Assign Vehicle Ownership: The number of vehicles owned or leased by each household are determined as a function of household characteristics, land use characteristics, and transportation system characteristics. Households in metropolitan areas are also sensitive to transit service level and urban mixed use indicators at the home location. The model first predicts zero-auto households and then the number of vehicles owned (up to 6), if any. 1.4.1.3 Land use attributes Two steps are required to add land use attributes to the synthetic population: Calculate 4D Measures: Several land use 5D built form measures are calculated for each Bzone. The density, diversity, and destination accessibilities are based on Bzone population, employment, dwelling units, and developable land area inputs. The design variable is a user input. Calculate Urban Mixed Use Measure: An urban mixed measure for the household is calculated based on population density of the home Bzone and dwelling unit type. The model is based on 2001 NHTS data. The model iterates to match an optional input target on the share of households to locate in urban mixed-use areas. 1.4.1.4 Land use-household linkages Several land use attributes are added to each household: Assign Location Types: Households are assigned to land use location types  urban, town, or rural  by random allocation based on the households dwelling unit type and input proportions on the mix of dwelling types in its enclosing Bzone. Predict Housing: Dwelling unit types are assigned to regular and group quarter households based on the input Bzone supply of dwelling units by type. Residential households also consider the relative costliness of housing within the Azone (logged ratio of the households income relative to mean income in their Azone), household size, oldest age person, and the interaction of size and income ratio. Locate Employment: The number of input jobs by Bzone and employment type (retail, service, total) are scaled so that total jobs equals total household workers within the Marea. A worker table is developed and each worker is assigned to a work Bzone. The assignment essentially uses a gravity-type model with tabulations of workers and jobs by Bzone (marginal controls) and distance between residence and employment Bzones (IPF seed, inverse of straight-line distances between home and all work Bzone centroids). 1.4.1.5 Policy levers Several assumptions about parking, demand management, and mobility services can also be coded: Assign Parking Restrictions: Households are assigned specific parking restrictions and fees for their residence, workplace(s), and other places they are likely to visit based on parking inputs by BZone (within Bzones coded as within metropolitan areas [Marea] only). Residential Parking Restrictions &amp; Fees: The number of free parking spaces available at the households residence is set based on input value that identify the average residential parking spaces by dwelling type in each Bzone. For household vehicles that cannot be parked in a free space a residential parking cost (part of auto ownership costs) is identified as a function of input parking rates for the home Bzone (if any). Employer Parking and Fees: Which workers pay for parking is set by inputs that define the proportion of workers facing parking fees in each Bzone. Whether their payment is part of a cash out/buy back program is similarly set by input proportions by Bzone and associated fees set by input parking rates for the work Bzone. Non-work Parking Fees: The cost of parking for other activities such as shopping is estimated as the likelihood that a household would visit each Bzone and the parking fee in that Bzone. The likelihood is calculated with a gravity-type model, given the relative amount of activity in the Bzone (numbers of households by Bzone and the scaled retail and service job attractions by Bzone as marginals) and the proximity to each destination (inverse distance matrix from home Bzone seed matrix). The average daily parking cost is a weighted average of the fee faced in each destination bzone and the likelihood of visiting that Bzone. Assign Demand Management: Households are assigned to individualized marketing programs based on input participation levels within their home Bzone. Each worker in the household can also be assigned to an employee commute options program based on input participation levels for workers within their assigned work Bzone. A simple percentage reduction in household VMT is applied based on the households participation in one or more of these program (maximum of multiple program participation, to avoid double-counting). Worker reductions are only applied to that workers work travel portion of overall household VMT, and summed if multiple workers in the household participate in such programs. Caution: The model assumes high-caliber TDM programs are in place that produce significant VMT savings. Inputs should reflect this. Assign CarSvc Availability: A car service level is assigned to each household based on the input car service coverage for where the household resides (Bzone). High Car Service availability can have an impact on auto ownership (households may own fewer vehicles where high level car service is available) and auto operating cost (see the discussion in the next chapter on household costs and budgets). 1.4.2 Household multimodal travel Watch a video overview of the Household Multimodal Travel module Travel of various modes by households (vehicle, transit, bike, and walk modes) is estimated as a simple function of the rich demographic and land use attributes of the household. In metropolitan areas travel is also influenced by inputs on transport supply on a per capita basis, such as available roadway capacity and bus-equivalent transit service levels. Transit, bike, and walk trips are also influenced by household VMT (i.e.Â if household VMT decreases, trips by these modes increase, and vise verse). Traditional travel models incorporate behavioral dynamics in choice models to build tours and trips for each synthetic person. VisionEval, by contrast, uses simple regression equations that directly estimate average per capita trips and miles by mode, linked by average trip lengths. After adjusting VMT for household budget limitations it is further adjusted for household participation in TDM programs (home &amp; work-based) and short-trip SOV diversion before calculating household trips for all modes. The households bike miles are also adjusted to reflect SOV diversion input. The following sections describe each module, which are implemented in sequence: The households daily VMT is calculated without household budget adjustments The households vehicle operating costs are calculated The households vehicle operating cost budget is calculated and daily VMT is adjusted to fit within the budget if necessary Daily VMT reductions due to TDM measures and short-trip SOV diversions are calculated and applied Vehicle and non-vehicular (AltMode) trips are calculated for each household 1.4.2.1 Transport supply Transport supply variables are defined in two steps. Note that these calculations are only carried out within metropolitan areas (Mareas) only: Assign Transit Service: Transit service levels are input for each metropolitan areas and neighborhood (Bzone). Annual revenue-miles (i.e.Â transit miles in revenue service) by eight transit modes are read from inputs for each metropolitan area. A Bzone-level Transit D attribute defines access to transit (not yet work access) for each household based on inputs on relative transit accessibility. Using factors derived from the National Transit Database (NTD), input annual transit revenue miles for each of the eight transit modes are converted to bus-equivalent miles by three transit vehicle types (van, bus, and rail). Per capita relative transit supply and bus-equivalent service-miles are calculated. Assign Road Miles: Stores input on the numbers of freeway lane-miles and arterial lane-miles by metropolitan area and year. Computes the relative roadway supply, arterial and freeway lane-miles per capita. 1.4.2.2 Household travel calculations Household travel by vehicles are calculated in three steps: Calculate Household Daily VMT (Dvmt): Household average daily vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is estimated as a function of household characteristics(income, workers, children, drivers), vehicle ownership, and attributes of the neighborhood (population density) and metropolitan area (urban mixed-use, transit service level, freeway lane-miles) where the household resides. It also calculates household VMT percentiles which are used by other modules to calculate whether a household is likely to own an electric vehicle (EV) and to calculate the proportions of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) VMT powered by electricity. These values are derived from the 2001 NHTS data. CalculateVehicleTrips: This module calculates average daily vehicle trips for households consistent with the household VMT. Average length of household vehicle trips is estimated as a function of household characteristics (drivers/non-driers, income), vehicle ownership (auto sufficiency), and attributes of the neighborhood (population density) and metropolitan area (urban mixed-use, freeway lane-miles) where the household resides, and interactions among these variables. The average trip length is divided into the average household VMT to get an estimate of average number of daily vehicle trips. Calculate AltMode Trips: This module calculates household transit trips, walk trips, and bike trips. The models are sensitive to household VMT so they are run after all household VMT adjustments (e.g., to account for cost on household VMT) are made. Twelve models estimate trips for the three modes in metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas, in two steps each. The first step determines whether a household has any AltMode trips and the second part determines the number of trips. All of the models include terms for household characteristics (size, income, age mix) and the households overall VMT. Neighborhood factors (population density) factors into all but the bike trip models. For households in metropolitan areas transit service level has an impact as well, with transit ridership also sensitive to when residents live in urban mixed-use neighborhoods. 1.4.2.3 SOV diversion Household single-occupant vehicle (SOV) travel is reduced to achieve bike and micro-transportation input policy goals, i.e., for diverting a portion of SOV travel within a 20-mile tour distance (round trip distance). This allows evaluating the potential for light-weight vehicles (e.g.Â bicycles, electric bikes, electric scooters) and infrastructure to support their use, in reducing SOV travel. First, the amount of the households VMT that occurs in SOV tours having round trip distances of 20 miles or less is estimated. Then the average trip length within those tours is estimated. Both models are sensitive to household characteristics(drivers, income, kids), vehicle ownership (auto sufficiency), and attributes of the neighborhood (population density, dwelling type) and metropolitan area (urban mixed-use, freeway lane-miles) where the household resides, and the households overall VMT. The diversion of these short trips is assumed to only apply in urban and town location types. The VMT reductions are allocated to households as a function of the households SOV VMT and (the inverse of) SOV trip length. In other words, it is assumed that households having more qualifying SOV travel and households having shorter SOV trips will be more likely to divert SOV travel to bicycle-like modes. The estimates of the households share of diverted VMT, average trip length of diverted VMT are applied elsewhere to reduce DMVT and increase bike trips. Zero vehicle households are not allowed to divert SOV travel. Census PUMS data is used to estimate the models. 1.4.2.4 DVMT reductions Each households VMT is adjusted for their TDM program(s) participation, if any, as well as input from metropolitan area short-trips SOV diversion goals. The SOV diversion also increases bike trips (diverted SOV VMT divided by SOV average trip length). 1.4.3 Vehicles, fuels and emissions The powertrains, fuels, and associated emissions datasets for all modeled vehicle groups are among the most complex inputs used in VisionEval. Default datasets are included in the VisionEval installer to simplify this for the user. The user can use these defaults or develop their own data that matches the VisionEval input requirements. It is anticipated that different datasets will be developed by users that can be shared with the VisionEval community. For example, one package may represent a base scenario of federal vehicle, fuel, and emission standards, while another package represents the California zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) rules and low carbon fuel for the home locations CarService. The model looks in household vehicle sales tables indexed by vehicle type and age to determine the probability of each powertrain in that sales year, along with its associated fuel efficiency and other attributes. Each household vehicle is assigned attributes consistent with these probabilities. In some cases electric vehicles (EVs) are replaced by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) if household VMT and residential charging limitations exist. The powertrain mix of non-household vehicle groups  car service, commercial service, transit, and heavy trucks  is applied to VMT (rather than individual vehicles) in the scenario year (rather than sales year). There is some input adjustment for average vehicle age and commercial vehicle type share. Fuels for each vehicle groups can rely on the package defaults, or use one of two input options. The user can either provide a composite carbon intensity representing all gallons of fuel used for that vehicle group, or provide fuel mix shares (base fuel mix, biofuel blend proportions), combined with package default lifecycle (well-to-wheels) carbon intensity for the individual fuels. The resulting carbon intensity per gallon are applied to gallons generated from VMT and vehicle fuel efficiency assumptions. Adjustments to fuel efficiency due to reduced speeds due to congestion as well as ITS operational programs (e.g., speed smoothing) and EcoDrive programs. The table below summarizes the vehicle and fuel options available within VisionEval. Vehicle Group Vehicle Types Powertrain Options Veh Input Adjustments Fuel Options Household Vehicles automobile, light truck ICE, HEV, EV, PHEV (default veh mix), age, %LtTrk gas/ethanol, diesel/biodiesel, CNG/RNG Car Service VMT automobile, light truck ICE, HEV, EV veh mix, age (HH %LtTrk) gas/ethanol, diesel/biodiesel, CNG/RNG Commercial Service VMT automobile, light truck ICE, HEV, EV veh mix, age, %LtTrk gas/ethanol, diesel/biodiesel, CNG/RNG Heavy Truck VMT heavy truck ICE, HEV, EV veh mix gas/ethanol, diesel/biodiesel, CNG/LNG Public Transit VMT van, bus, rail ICE, HEV, EV veh mix gas/ethanol, diesel/biodiesel, CNG/RNG Note that individual vehicles are modeled for households, based on sales year default datasets and age of the owned vehicle. Other groups vehicle and fuel attributes apply to VMT in the scenario modeled year. As a result, PHEVs do not exist other than household vehicles, instead PHEVs are represented as miles driven in HEVs and miles in EVs. Watch a video overview of vehicles, fuels, and emissions 1.4.3.1 Household vehicle table The household vehicle table is generated in two steps: Create Vehicle Table: A vehicle table is created with a record for every vehicle owned by the household, and additional vehicle records are added to reach the households number of driving age persons. Each vehicle record is populated with household ID and geography fields (Azone, Marea) and access time attributes. Each vehicle record is either own or (driving-age person without a vehicle) assigned access to a CarService level, depending upon coverage in the households home Bzone. Assign Vehicle Type:. Identifies how many household vehicles are light trucks and how many are automobiles as a function of number of vehicles, person-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-driver ratios, number of children, dwelling unit type, income, density, and urban mixed use data (in metropolitan areas only). 1.4.3.2 Powertrains and fuels defaults These values are defined in two steps: Load Default Values:. This script, run before the rest of VisionEval is started, reads and processes the default powertrains and fuels files in the package and creates datasets used by other modules to compute fuel and electricity consumption, and well as associated fuel and electricity carbon intensity emissions from vehicle travel. An Initialize step is run by VisionEval as part of its initialization on each run. Optional user-supplied vehicle and fuel input files, if any, are processed (including input data checks). When available, modules that compute carbon intensities of vehicle travel will use the user-supplied data instead of the package default datasets. 1.4.3.3 Assign household powertrains and fuels The powertrain and fuel type is assigned to each vehicle in each household in three steps: Assign Vehicle Age: Assigns vehicle ages to each household vehicle and CarService vehicle used by the household as a function of the vehicle group (household vehicles only), household income, and assumed mean vehicle age by vehicle type and Azone. The age model starts with an observed vehicle age distribution and relationship between vehicle age and income. These data are currently based on summaries of the 2001 NHTS. Adjustments are made based on user average vehicle age inputs (household by vehicle type, car service overall). Assign Household Vehicle Powertrain: This module assigns a powertrain type to each household vehicle. The age of each vehicle is used with default tables by vehicle type that identify the powertrain mix of vehicles sold in each sales year. Other default tables identify vehicle characteristics tied to powertrain that include battery range, fuel efficiency, and emissions rate. Assignments of EVs may be changed to PHEVs if the battery range is not compatible with estimated day-to-day trip lengths, or the home dwelling lacks vehicle charging availability. Calculate Carbon Intensity: This module calculates the average carbon intensity of fuels (grams CO2e per megajoule) by vehicle group and, if applicable, vehicle type. Average fuel carbon intensities for transit vehicle modes are calculated by metropolitan area, other vehicles are calculated for the entire model region. The module also reads the input average carbon intensity of electricity at the Azone level. 1.4.3.4 Assign non-household powertrains and fuels The assignment of powertrain and fuel characteristics is carried out in two steps: Calculate Transit Energy And Emissions: This module calculates the energy consumption and carbon emissions from transit vehicles in urbanized areas. Assumptions (package default or user input) on powertrain mix and fuels for three transit vehicle types by metropolitan area are applied to associated Marea transit service miles for these types. Assumptions (package default or user input) on average carbon intensity of fuel and electricity by transit vehicle types are then applied to Marea fuel and electricity usage across types to calculate carbon emissions. Calculate Commercial Energy And Emissions: The energy consumption and carbon emissions of heavy trucks and commercial service VMT (no vehicles) are calculated by on-road (not sales) year. VMT shares of Commercial Service powertrains by vehicle type and heavy truck powertrains are calculated (per package default or user input). Any fuel efficiency (MPG and MPKWH) adjustments are then applied, due to policies (EcoDriving, speed smoothing and/or congestion (including effects of any ITS operational and congestion fee policies). Ecodriving applies only to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and ITS operational policies and congestion apply only in metropolitan areas. Both vary by powertrain and for commercial vehicles, vehicle type. Combining fuel efficiency and VMT (from the Household Multimodal Travel Model) results in estimates of energy usage (fuel and electricity). Fuel carbon intensity for these modes is calculated by metropolitan area and/or region and applied to fuel and electricity usage to estimate CO2e emissions. 1.5 Adjustments 1.5.1 Congestion adjustments Congestion, only calculated on urbanized roads (a subset of metropolitan area roads, requires estimating and combining together the VMT of all vehicle groups. For non-household vehicles, base year VMT is calculated directly from inputs and model parameters, while future year is a function of the input growth basis. Initial allocations of DMVT across road class is based on input values. Light duty vehicle (LDV) VMT is allowed to re-allocate between freeways and arterials to balance demand (VMT) and roadway supply (lane-miles) through a generalized cost framework (including roadway speed and congestion fees, if any). Roadway supply (i.e., capacity) is adjusted by delay-reducing ITS operations policies based on fuel-speed curves by powertrain, the resulting congested speeds impact vehicle fuel efficiency. Further adjustments are applied to reflect any speed smoothing and EcoDrive programs that may not affect delay but reduce acceleration and deceleration with associated impacts on fuel efficiency. No fuel efficiency adjustments for congestion or policies are made to non-urban roadway VMT. The delays faced by each household and associated fuel economy impacts are applied to each individual households VMT and vehicles. Resulting overall average speeds, delays, and DMVT proportions, by road class at each congestion level on urbanized and other roads are also tabulated along with the resulting average per mile congestion fees paid, if any, and overall vehicle hours of delay (VHD) by vehicle group. Watch a video summary of VisionEvals congestion adjustment 1.5.1.1 Initialize roadway conditions The roadway conditions in the model are calculated in three steps: Load Default Road VMT Values: These calculations are completed before the model run starts. The base year roadway VMT is processed, including light duty vehicle and heavy truck VMT by state and urbanized area as well as VMT proportions by urbanized area, vehicle group (light duty vehicle, heavy truck, bus), and road class. The user can either provide direct inputs for these values or specify a state and/or urbanized area and the model will use default data from the 20xx USDOT Highway Statistics, where available. Initialize:. This step is run when the model run is initialized. User inputs used by several modules are read and checked (many with several valid options, proportions sum to 1, consistency, congestion fees increase with congestion level). Some of these values are optional, using default data where not specified. This includes various assumptions on base year VMT within both urbanized area(s) and the full model region, by vehicle group, allocation among road class, growth basis, and assumptions for freight vehicle groups. It also checks inputs on ITS operational policies and EcoDriving programs, including any user-specified other ops programs and congestion fees (by road class and congestion level). Calculate Road VMT: Adds together metropolitan area VMT of all vehicle groups (Households, CarService, Commercial Service, Heavy Truck, Transit) and allocates it across road classes (freeway, arterial, other), limiting it to urbanized area roadways for use in congestion calculations. To do so, several factors are established in the base year. One uses the input growth basis (population, income, household VMT) to estimate future year freight vehicle group (commercial service and heavy truck) VMT (using input base year VMT values by region and Marea, if provided, model-estimates otherwise). A second base year factor identifies the urban and non-urban allocation of VMT from metropolitan area households and related commercial service vehicles. For Heavy Trucks VMT an input specifies the proportion of VMT on urbanized roads while transit VMT (of all transit service modes) is assumed to only occur on urbanized roads. Base year allocations of urban VMT by vehicle group among road classes are based on input shares, subject to adjustment during subsequent congestion calculations. Finally, to assess delay faced by each household and associated fuel efficiency impacts, each individual households VMT is split between miles on urbanized and other road miles. 1.5.1.2 Congestion model and adjustments Three adjustments are made based on congestion levels: Calculate Road Performance: Congestion level by road class and the associated amounts of VMT are iteratively estimated. Light duty vehicle (LDV) VMT is allowed to re-allocate between freeways and arterials to balance demand and roadway supply (lane-miles) through a generalized cost framework (including roadway speed and congestion fees, if any and an estimated base year urbanized area lambda parameter based on the areas population and freeway-arterial lane-mile ratio). DMVT allocation at different aggregate demand-supply ratios relies on data from the 2009 Urban Mobility Study (UMS) for 90 urbanized areas, where the model chooses the 5-10 cities with most similar congestion ratios. The supply calculation considers the delay-reduction effects of deploying urban area ITS operations programs (freeway ramp metering, freeway incident management, arterial signal coordination, arterial access control or user-defined other ops programs. The standard ITS-operations program impacts are based on research (Bigazzi &amp; Clifton 2011). Non-urban speeds are also calculated, using a simple ratio of rural-to-urban travel volumes. The resulting average speeds, delay and DMVT proportions, by road class at each congestion level on urbanized and other metropolitan area roads are calculated, as is the resulting average per mile congestion fees paid, if any, and overall VHD by vehicle group. Calculate Mpg Mpkwh Adjustments: Adjustments to fuel efficiency (MPG and MPKwhr) for all vehicle groups resulting from traffic congestion, congestion fees, ITS speed smoothing (i.e.Â active traffic management which reduces speed variation), and EcoDriving are calculated. The fuel-speed curves vary by road class, congestion powertrains (LdIce, LdHev, LdEv, HdIce) and, where applicable, vehicle type relative to reference speeds by road class. The adjustments are based on drive-cycle level simulation research (Bigazzi &amp; Clifton 2011). Note that no adjustments are made for ITS policies (standard and speed smoothing policies) or EcoDrive programs on other road classes (non-freeway or arterials) and non-urbanized roads, which are assumed to be uncongested. Adjust Household Vehicle MPg Mpkwh: Implements the fuel efficiency (MPG and MPKwh) adjustments of household vehicles (including Car Service VMT), reflecting the effects of congestion, congestion fees, ITS speed smoothing, and eco-driving that were calculated elsewhere. These adjustments vary by vehicle powertrain, vehicle type, and the proportion of the households travel that is driven on urban and non-urban roads within the metropolitan area. Joint effects are calculated as the product of congestion speed effects and the maximum of implemented speed-smoothing policies (eco-driving &amp; ITS-speed smoothing). 1.5.2 Household costs and budgets Two adjustments are made in response to household budgets. Auto ownership costs are calculated and an adjustment is made to the number of household owned autos if the costs are greater than switching to a High level Car Service, where available (subject to input limits on Car Service substitutability). Vehicle ownership costs include financing, depreciation, insurance (unless in PAYD program), annual registration fees, and residential parking fees. Additionally, in order to respond to pricing policies and energy costs, VisionEval imposes an operating cost budget limitation. Household VMT is constrained such that annual vehicle operating costs must stay below a maximum share of annual household income, or budget limit. A household-specific average annual vehicle operating costs is first calculated, including out-of-pocket per mile costs for each household owned and Car Service vehicles used by the household, as well as time-equivalent cost (input access times, estimates of VMT at congested speeds, and value of time input). Vehicle operating costs determine the proportional split of VMT across household vehicles. Out-of-pocket costs include the energy, maintenance, repair, &amp; tires, road use taxes (including EV surcharge and optional calculation of fee to fully recover road costs), work/non-work parking, PAYD insurance, input share of carbon and other social costs, as well as CarService fees by the household. Note that time-equivalent costs are only used to allocate travel between household vehicles (including car services used by the household). Time-equivalent cost is not used in the balancing of household vehicle operating cost and budget. The following sections describe each module that contributes to this concept. Watch a video overview of costs and budgets 1.5.2.1 Auto Ownership Cost &amp; Adjustment Two steps are required to calculate and adjust auto ownership costs: Calculate Vehicle Own Cost: Average vehicle ownership costs are calculated for each vehicle based on the vehicle type, age, and annual VMT (financing, depreciation, and insurance), annual registration fees (flat and ad valorum), combined with any residential parking fees (if household exceeds free parking limits). To do so, PAYD insurance participation is assigned based on household characteristics (drivers by age, annual mileage, income, location type, vehicle type and age) and input PAYD insurance program participation. The ownership cost is converted into an average vehicle-specific ownership cost per mile by dividing by estimated household VMT per vehicle. Note that PAYD insurance does not affect the cost of vehicle ownership when determining whether a household will substitute car services for one or more of their vehicles. It does affect the out-of-pocket operating cost used in budget limitations on household VMT. Adjust Vehicle Ownership: Household vehicle ownership is adjusted based on a comparison of the cost of owning versus high car service per mile rates, where available. The module identifies all household vehicles in a High car service area, where the car service mileage rate exceeds the households estimated vehicle ownership cost per annual household VMT. The households vehicle table entry changes from Own to HighCarSvc for these vehicles, limited by input assumptions regarding the average likelihood that an owner would substitute car services for a household vehicle (separate values are specified by vehicle type). Other auto ownership values are also updated (e.g., insurance, total vehicles). 1.5.2.2 Auto Operating Cost &amp; Adjustment Three primary adjustments adjustments to auto operating cost are carried out in VisionEval: Calculate Vehicle Operating Cost: A composite per mile cost is calculated as an out-of-pocket cost for various household and Car Service vehicle VMT (see below), combined with cost equivalent of travel time (access time and travel time at congested speeds times value of time (VOT)). Total costs result from applying this vehicle-specific cost rate to each vehicles VMT, where VMT is split among household vehicles (including car services used by household members) as a (reciprocal) function of this vehicle-specific composite cost rate: Vehicle maintenance, repair, and tire cost (MRT) costs are calculated as a function of the vehicle type, powertrain and vehicle age based on data from the American Automobile Association (AAA) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Fuel and energy costs are calculated as energy rates time average fuel efficiency (miles per gallon or Kwhr electricity). Gas taxes are federal, state and local per gallon taxes to cover road costs. For Electric vehicles, an equivalent per mile cost is calculated and can be applied to some or all electric vehicles ($/gallon or EV vehicle surcharge tax). Other Road Cost Recovery taxes (i.e.Â VMT tax) is a user input. If the (optional) BalanceRoadCostsAndRevenues module is run, an extra VMT tax is calculated that recovers household share of road costs, consistent across all model households. Congestion fees are calculated average congestion price ($/mile) for travel on urbanized roads in the Marea multiplied by the proportion of household travel occurring on those roads. Carbon fee and other social cost fees are carbon cost per mile is calculated as the input carbon price times the average household emissions rate (grams/mile), a VMT-weighting of all vehicles in the household. Of the other social costs, some are per gallon (non-EV vehicle miles) others per mile (regardless of powertrain). The full per mile costs are discounted to only reflect the input proportion of social cost paid by user. Daily parking costs from work parking costs (workers who pay for parking) and other parking cost (cost of parking for shopping, etc.) are summed and divided by the household DMVT. Note that residential parking costs are included in the vehicle ownership not per mile cost calculations. Pay-as-you-drive (PAYD) insurance is defined for participating households as the sum of the annual insurance cost for all the household vehicles is divided by the annual household VMT. Car-service costs are the cost of using a car service (dollars/mile) is a user input by car service level (Low, High). Balance Road Costs And Revenues: Optionally, an extra mileage tax ($/mile) for household vehicles needed to make up any difference in the cost of constructing, maintaining, and operating roadways and the revenues from total road cost fees including fuel, VMT, and congestion charges. Optionally, an additional mileage fee ($/mile) on household travel is calculated that would fully pay for roadway costs attributable to household vehicle travel. The cost of existing and new freeway and arterial lane-miles by Marea is calculated from the difference in input lane-miles relative to the base year and input unit road costs (constructing, maintaining, and operating). Reductions in lane-miles are ignored. The proportion of road costs attributable to households is set as the ratio of household VMT divided by the sum of household (including CarService), commercial service, and car-equivalent heavy truck VMT (multiply by PCE). Average road taxes collected per household vehicle mile are calculated as a weighted average of the average road tax per mile of each household (calculated by the CalculateVehicleOperatingCost module) using the household VMT (calculated by the BudgetHouseholdDvmt module) as the weight. Currently no annual fees contribute to road cost recovery. Budget Household Dvmt: Household VMT is adjusted to keep within the households vehicle operating cost budget, based on the historic maximum proportion of income the household is willing to pay for vehicle operations. This proportions varies with income. The households DMVT is then reduced as needed to keep annual out-of-pocket vehicle operating cost within that share of the households annual income. Annual vehicle operating costs include the households VMT times their out-of-pocket per mile vehicle costs, adding credits for selected annual payments (annual work parking fee if in a work parking cash-out-buy-back program, annual vehicle insurance if in a PAYD insurance program, and annual auto ownership costs if car service program reduced auto ownership). The module relies on aggregate survey data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) for years 2003-2015. 1.6 Processing VisionEval is designed to be easy to install, run, and summarize, even when comparing scores of different scenarios. It produces consistent and detailed performance metrics. The user can modify the metrics produced by the model or define their own from data exported from the model. There are also several ways to think about validation of the model within the VisionEval mindset. These topics are explored in this chapter. 1.6.1 Running VisionEval VisionEval is implemented entirely in the R statistical language and operates on recent versions of Microsoft Windows. All development work is done there, although macOS and Linux versions are usually distributed. A fully self-contained installer for the more recent production release of VisionEval can be found on the download page. It permits installation of the full VisionEval platform, to include example data, even behind firewalls that prevent access to R Project and GitHub repositories. Once installed the user assembles data into a standard directory structure. Once the model run script is customized by the user it is typically run from a command prompt. Running it in this manner allows several different scenarios to be run at the same time with minimal user interaction. The results can then be mined or visualized using a variety of VisionEval and third-party products. Some users use R Shiny or similar interactive environments for summarizing and visualizing the output from VisionEval. Such an environment is especially useful when comparing key metrics from a large number of scenarios. 1.6.2 Typical outputs VisionEval generates a large set of performance metrics at varying summary levels. Several pre-defined metrics are compiled for mobility, economic, land use, environmental, and energy categories in each model run. They can be tabulated for individual scenarios or compared to other scenarios, as well as visualized using a variety of tools. The intermediate data generated during the various VisionEval module steps can be compiled as performance metrics, both in absolute and per-capita terms and at various geographies. Traditional transportation network metrics such as VMT, vehicle and person hours of travel, and total delay are easily compiled by overall or focused areas within the model. Likewise, emission estimates and fuel consumption are tabulated. These can be viewed in standard reports or in VEScenarioManager files, especially when comparing such values between scenarios. One example of a set of region-wide performance metrics used by Oregon DOT includes: Mobility Daily per capita VMT Annual walk trips per capita Daily Bike trips per capita Economy Annual all vehicle delay per capita (hours) Daily household parking costs Annual HH vehicle operating cost (fuel, taxes, parking) Annual HH ownership costs (depreciation, vehicle maintenance, tires, finance charge, insurance, registration) Land Use Residents living in mixed use areas Housing type (SF: MF) Environmental Annual GHG emissions per capita HH vehicle GHG/mile Commercial vehicle GHG/mile Transit Vehicle GHG/mile Energy Annual all vehicle fuel consumption per capita (gallons) Average all vehicle fuel efficiency (net miles per gallon) Annual external social costs per households (total/% paid) 1.6.3 Exporting data Most of the data generated during a VisionEval model run can be exported (using exporter.R) if desired for further analyses. The user can then mine and visualize the data using a variety of open source and proprietary tools. This provides the user with considerable flexibility for creating more detailed statistics than those provided by the program. These VisionEval outputs might further serve as inputs to other models (e.g., emissions models, economic impact models) and visualization tools, and compilation of additional performance metrics. 1.6.4 Validation Setting up the model includes the steps required to apply the model for a given study. It is somewhat related to validation, both for informing what types of studies that VisionEval are appropriately sensitive to and interpreting the results. See the Getting Started page on the wiki for an overview of getting started initially. Validation is the assessment of a models suitability for its intended purpose, often informed by comparisons against information not used in its original development. In traditional transportation planning models the comparison of observed versus modeled link flows is often a key component of validation. VisionEval is a data-driven model in that most of its inputs values are exogenously defined rather than emergent behavior from complex mathematical equations. Its aggregate representation of travel demand dictates that it be validated at the same level, with an emphasis on a wider number of comparisons than many traditional models. The metric used in validation can range from relatively few, such as per-capita mobility estimates (e.g., VMT and VHT by mode), to a large number of more detailed targets. Examples of the latter include comparisons to external sources (e.g., HPMS data, DMV data), sensitivity tests of key variables, and comparison to comparable communities. An example of detailed validation criteria used by the Oregon DOT provides examples of these targets. There are several options for making adjustments in order to calibrate and validate the models. These adjustments vary in difficulty, and the most appropriate approach varies by module. From easiest to most difficult the options for making adjustments are: Self-calibration: Several of the modules are self-calibrating in that they automatically adjust calculations to match input values without intervention by the user.[Selected value should be validated to confirm the calculations are done correctly] Adjustment of model inputs: Some modules allow the user to optionally enter data that can be used to adjust the models to improve their match to observed conditions. Model estimation data: Several modules use data specific to the region where the model is deployed, such as household synthesis. Functions within each module generate cross-tabulations required from these data. Census PUMSCensus PUMS data from Oregon were used to develop the original models, and should be replaced with PUMS data for the modeled area. Model estimation scripts: An advanced user or developer can make adjustments to the model code itself in order to facilitate better matching observed local behavior or patterns. This, of course, is the most difficult option and opens up potential for significant errors, but it is possible for users that know what they are doing. The main validation targets have historically included household income, vehicle ownership, vehicle miles of travel, and fuel consumption. The number of workers and drivers within each geography have recently become more widely used. These statistical comparisons can be made for the modeled area as a whole or for large geographies nested within them (e.g., Azones, Mareas). Sensitivity tests should be performed to evaluate the reasonableness (eg. correct direction and magnitude) of the VisionEval output estimates. Comparable community applications of VisionEval may also provide a reasonableness check that the model is functioning appropriately. Note that HPMS definition of VMT differs from that used in VisionEval. VisionEval reports on all household travel regardless of where it occurs, and adds Commercial vehicle and Heavy Duty Truck and Bus travel on MPO roads. HPMS reports vehicular travel of all modes on roads within the MPO boundary. Additional detail on validation can be found in this validation document 1.7 Lexicon 5D built form measures The five dimensions considered in designing efficient and sustainable cities include density, design, destination access, distance to transit, and diversity of the built environment. The five dimensions build upon the original 3Ds (density, diversity, and design) advanced by Cervero &amp; Kockelman (1997). These measures are calculated in the Calculate4DMeasures module during household synthesis. access time The time required to get from the origin to the vehicle (or in the case of CarService, the time for the vehicle to get to the traveler) and the time to get from the vehicle to the destination (including time to park the vehicle). These values are defined for vehicles owned by the household and for two levels of CarService (low and high availability levels) in each Bzone. These factors are defined in azone_vehicle_access_times.csv and used by the CalculateVehicleOperatingCost module in the VETravelPerformance package. Additional details age group VisionEval uses the same age groups used in the U.S. Census0-14, 15-19, 20-29, 30-54, 55-64, and 65+ years old. The number of persons in each age group are defined for each synthetic household. Additional details auto operating cost The out-of-pocket costs used to estimate the cost per mile of operating an automobile. These costs include fuel (energy), maintenance, tires, and repairs for all households. In addition, pollution or carbon taxes, parking charges, pay-as-you-drive (PAYD) insurance costs, and road use cost or VMT taxes are included where coded for the households enclosed Bzone. For car service use, the operating cost is the assumed fare per mile. The costs are calculated in the CalculateHhVehicleOperatingCosts module of the VETravelPerformance package. Additional details auto ownership costs The average cost of auto ownership is calculated based upon vehicle type (automobile, light truck) and age using typical cost figures from AAA data. The cost per mile is estimated by dividing the average cost by the household daily VMT estimates produced by the model. A depreciation model is used to adjust this cost based upon the vehicle type, age, and annual miles driven (daily VMT converted into annual miles). The ownership costs represent the full costs of ownership, to include depreciation, financing, insurance, etc. They also include any residential parking cost the household may have. Auto ownership is adjusted when the per-mile cost of owning a car is higher than car service (mobility services) when the latter has high availability. This adjustment is made in the AdjustVehicleOwnership module. Additional details on auto ownership and auto ownership adjustments auto sufficiency Auto sufficiency is achieved when the number of vehicles available to a household is equal to or greater than the number of licensed drivers in a household. A household in auto insufficient when that is not true. Zero-auto households are cases where the household has access to a vehicle. In the age of ubiquitous mobility services this definition may become less important in describing mobility options open to the household. bus-equivalent-miles The total bus revenue miles for a transit system are divided by the assumed transit vehicle type capacities to arrive at bus-equivalent miles of service. The total bus revenue miles for a transit system are divided by the population of the enclosing Marea(s) to compute per capita bus-equivalent miles. Additional details carbon intensity A emissions measure in grams of carbon dioxide equivalents per megajoule of energy. VisionEval uses a well-to-wheels estimate that takes into account not only the emissions resulting from the use of the fuel (tank-to-wheels measures) but also the carbon emissions required to produce and transport the fuel it where it is purchased by consumers. Default values are estimated from various sources in VisionEval. The user can specify different values. These values are used in several places in the VEPowertrainsAndFuels package. Additional details carbon price A carbon price in dollars per ton is used to estimate part of the social cost of emissions in the CalculateVehicleOperatingCost module of the VETravelPerformance package. Additional details CarService This is a synonym for popular ride-sharing services provided by mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) companies. They are also more commonly referred to as mobility services. cash-out/buy-back program Parking cash-out schemes are an employee benefit that enables them to accept taxable cash income in lieu of paid or subsidized parking at the workplace. The cash-out is sometimes combined with discounted transit passes in some places. It is used as an inducement to reduce commuting by auto, especially in single-occupant vehicles. FHWA has an excellent primer on the topic, while many consider Donald Shoups online book a definitive resource on the topic. Census PUMS The Public Use Microsample (PUMS) data are anonymized long form responses from the American Community Survey (ACS) that enable custom tabulations, summaries, and visualizations. The PUMS were formerly associated with each dicennial Census of Households and Population. The samples are anonymized by assigning each to a Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) of 100,000 or more households. Several multi-dimensional summaries used in model estimation are gleaned from the PUMS that cannot be obtained from other Census data. Data indexed along these multiple dimensions permit the PUMS data to be fused with travel survey data and to create synthetic populations. ACS PUMS data from 2005-19 in annual increments can be accessed from the PUMS website. Data from 1996-2004 can be accessed separately. commercial service The use of vehicles by firms and government agencies for non-personal travel other than the delivery of freight. (e.g., parcel delivery, business meetings, sales calls). Both automobiles and light trucks can be used for commercial services, and are defined both in terms of powertrain and fuel type (gasoline, diesel, or compressed natural gas). Additional details congestion fee The average amount paid per mile in congestion pricing fee. This is an input to the CalculateRoadPerformance module in the VETravelPerformance package. Additional details congestion level Five levels of congestion  none, moderate, heavy, severe, and extreme  are estimated within each Marea by comparing [relative roadway supply] with the aggregate level of daily VMT (demand). Lookup tables are then used to estimate average speeds and delay for freeways and arterials. The effects of four standard operations programs (freeway ramp metering and incident management, arterial signal progression and access control) and optional user-defined programs are included in the calculations. The calculations are carried out in the CalculateRoadPerformance module of the VETravelPerformance package. Additional details dwelling unit type Each household inhabits a dwelling unit that is either a single-family dwelling, a multi-family dwelling, or group quarters. Additional details EcoDrive A term used to describe energy efficient use of vehicles in order to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. Primarily a European pursuit, EcoDriving involves changes to vehicular technology, vehicle navigation and automation systems, and driving techniques. Factors expressing the degree of EcoDriving adoption are applied in the CalculateMpgMpkwhAdjustments module of the VETravelPerformance package. Additional details employee commute options program A voluntary employer-based program aimed at reducing solo commutes by automobile using strategies and incentive tailored towards each specific organization. Strategies range from providing information and management encouragement to use alternative modes of transportation to cash incentives. Cash-out/buy-in programs are one example of the latter. A massDOT guidebook provides extensive information about such programs. In some states such programs are mandatory for large employers. Information on Oregons Employee Commute Options program includes information about conducting employee surveys to demonstrate progress towards commuting trip reduction targets. employment type Zonal employment estimates in VisionEval are made for retail, service, and total employment categories. The delineation of retail and service employment is typically by the two-digit sectors in the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS). The NAICS system is widely used in most governmental reporting systems. EV surcharge Some states impose a tax on electric vehicles beyond sales tax and vehicle registration fees to make up for the shortfall in gasoline sales tax revenue they might otherwise contribute towards the costs of roadway infrastructure. The methods and rates vary considerably, with some EV owners paying more in sales tax and EV surcharges than most owners of conventional autos. The EV surcharge can be accounted for in the CalculateVehicleOperatingCosts module in the VETravelPerformance package. Additional details freeway lane-miles The sum of the number of lanes multiplied by the length of each freeway segment within a metropolitan area (Marea). The lane-miles of arterials are calculated separated (see roadway lane-miles). Both are created in the AssignRoadMiles module of the VETransportSupply package. Additional details freight vehicle groups see vehicle groups fuel efficiency VisionEval does not simulate driving cycles so uses measures of relative fuel efficiency derived from the USEPAs Physical Emission Rate Estimator (PERE) for different vehicle powertrains during congested conditions. The user-supplied values in congestion_efficiency.csv define the congestion performance of each powertrain relative to best (1.0) and worst (0.0) values. The data are used in the LoadDefaultValues module in the VEPowertrainsAndFuels package. Additional details fuel-speed curves A set of exogenously calculated adjustments to the average fuel economy of vehicles as a function of the vehicle type (light-duty or heavy-duty), powertrain, and roadway type. The curves and their derivation are described by Bigazzi &amp; Clifton (2011). growth basis The growth in commercial and heavy truck travel over time increase at the same rate as the population does, as firms and establishments are not explicitly modeled in VisionEval. Future year daily VMT is calculated as a function of population or income from heavy trucks or population, income, or household daily VMT for commercial service. Additional details heavy truck A single class of heavy trucks are used to represent all commercial vehicles larger than the light duty trucks included in the commercial service vehicles. The same vehicle operating and emissions parameters specified for other vehicle groups are defined for heavy trucks, and their impacts are calculated in several VisionEval packages. individualized marketing programs Education and public outreach efforts designed to encourage voluntary travel behavior changes. Rather than using broad messages for the entire population this approaches targets specific groups of travelers with information more relevant to them. A concise fact sheet describes its implementation in Oregon. Dill &amp; Mohr (2010) investigate the long-term effectiveness of such programs. intelligent transportation systems (ITS) Systems that integrate information, communications, and advanced vehicular technologies into transportation infrastructure, maintenance, and operations programs to improve mobility and safety. ITS programs are typically centrally controlled by transportation agencies rather than individually autonomous solutions like personal navigation systems. Examples of ITS systems include traveler information systems (e.g., 511 systems, variable message signs), adaptive traffic signal systems, ramp metering, and electronic toll collection. ITS see intelligent transportation systems lambda parameter The assumed split of light-duty household and commercial service vehicles between freeways and arterials is calculated dynamically as the ratio of the respective average travel speeds and an urbanized area specific factor (lambda). The latter adjusts the raw ratio of speeds to match observed percentages using data from 90 urbanized areas. The calculation is carried out in the CalculateRoadPerformance module. Additional details lifecycle A label used to describe the stage of life that a households members are at. This is guessed at in VisionEval as a function of the number of adults, children, and workers in the household. This is assigned in the AssignLifeCycle module. It assumes one of 10 values defined in the 2009 NHTS LIF_CYC variable Additional details location type Each household is classified by whether its enclosing Bzone is located in an urban, town, or rural area. The location_type variable is defined for each Bzone. Additional details metropolitan area (Marea) A select set of Azones that are used in VisionEval to define a common metropolitan area (Marea). Separate VisionEval functions are often applied for metropolitan areas, making use of information on road, transit, and urban mixed used variables only present in the urbanized portion of the metropolitan area. Metropolitan areas in VisionEval are typically equivalent to Census urbanized areas. Additional details mixed use see urban mixed-use National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) The NHTS collects household and traveler information and travel diaries from a random sample of U.S. households. The 2017 survey collected data from 26,000 households selected nationwide and an additional 103,112 additional add-on samples purchased by nine states and four regional and metropolitan planning agencies. The information collected is comparable to the data collected in bespoke household travel surveys. The latest year for which NHTS data are available is 2017, with seven prior surveys dating to 1969 conducted before it. Publicly available data are available with reduced geographic detail (i.e., households only coded to state and place size ranges) for 2017 and prior years. VisionEval was developed using the public use NHTS data from 2001, while the Multimodal Travel package was developed using confidential 2009 NHTS data. NHTS see National Household Travel Survey Non-institutional group quarters Persons living in non-institutional group dwellings (e.g., college dormitories, halfway houses). Persons living in institutional group dwellings are not included in VisionEval, and include hospital patients, prison inmates, and military barracks. out-of-pocket cost The variable costs of automobile usage are considered out-of-pocket costs. They are often considered the perceived cost of using automobiles. In VisionEval they include the cost of fuel and parking or the cost of using CarService. The out-of-pockets are a subset of the auto operating costs. parking fee Parking fees are a subset of parking restrictions. Parking fees can be paid for residential, workplace, or other destinations. parking restrictions Parking restrictions and fees affect households at their places of residence and work, as well as other places they travel to within the modeled area. This information is coded at the Bzone level and typically includes the average number of free parking spaces by dwelling unit type (single family, multi-family, and group quarters), the average daily parking cost, and proportion of workers who pay for parking or participate in a cash out-buy back program. Parking restrictions are used for Azones that are members of a defined metropolitan area (Marea) within the model. Additional details Pay-as-you-drive (PAYD) An insurance program, also known as usage-based insurance, whose premiums are based on actual usage of the insured vehicle as well as how well you drive. It is viewed by some as the emerging standard in insurance. Using a PAYD assumption in VisionEval enables the analyst to more precisely calculate auto ownership cost based on household daily VMT estimates. The proportion of households using PAYD are included in the calculations carried out by the CalculateVehicleOwnCost module. Additional details Passenger car equivalents (PCE) A factor that indicates the number of light-duty vehicles that a heavy truck is equivalent to in terms of vehicle length and lane usage when calculating roadway capacity. It is used in the BalanceRoadCostsAndRevenues module of the VETravelPerformance package. Additional details powertrain VisionEval uses detailed operating and emissions characteristics from several different types of vehicular powertrains, enabling scenarios to be quickly assembled with different assumptions about their mix in future years. Four powertrain types are presently defined in VisionEvalinternal combustion engines (ICE), hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), and battery electric vehicles (BEV). The powertrain is assigned to each household vehicle in the AssignHhVehiclePowertrain module. regular households Related and unrelated persons living in the same dwelling unit, but not including persons living in non-institutional group quarters relative roadway supply A synthetic measure that divides the total arterial and freeway lane-miles (i.e., the sum of the length in miles times the number of lanes for each distinct roadway segment) by the sum of the estimated trip lengths for all households. This calculation is carried out for each Marea and year. Thus, it is a measure that only applies in metropolitan areas defined in the model. This value is calculated in the AssignRoadMiles module and is used in several other modules. Additional details road class The vehicle miles of travel (VMT) calculated for households, commercial service, and heavy trucks is split between three classes of roadways  freeways, arterials, and other roadways  in the LoadDefaultRoadDvmtValues module of the VETravelPerformance package. Additional details road costs VisionEval calculates an average mileage tax for household vehicles needed to make up any differences in the cost of constructing, maintaining, and operating roadways from the revenues from fuel taxes and pricing schemes (e.g., VMT taxes, congestion taxes). The latter are calculated based on assumptions about fuel consumption (a function of total daily VMT) and fuel efficiency, although this information can be both an input (default) and optional calculation with user-supplied data. While VisionEval adds this to the auto operating costs of households it is important to note that such costs might not be passed on by governments in future years as assumed by VisionEval. The road costs and revenues are reconciled in the BalanceRoadCostsAndRevenue module in the VETravelPerformance package. Additional details road lane-miles The sum of the number of lanes multiplied by the length of each arterial roadway segment within a metropolitan area (Marea). The lane-miles of freeways are calculated separated (see freeway lane-miles. Both are created in the AssignRoadMiles module of the VETransportSupply package. Additional details road use taxes see road costs short-trip SOV diversion The DivertSovTravel module reduces travel in single-occupant vehicles (SOVs) to account for assumed availability of solo travel alternatives such as bicycles (traditional and electric) and scooters. The user inputs a goal for diverting a proportion of SOV travel within a 20-mile round-trip distance (i.e., for trips longer than 10 miles in one direction). Additional details social costs Present and future generations bear costs due to the impact of transportation that are not fully recouped through auto operating costs or auto ownership costs, such as the costs of abating pollution, security and safety costs, and noise. VisionEval includes these costs in their full-cost accounting approach to calculating costs and benefits. The social cost parameters are defined as inputs to the CalculateVehicleOperatingCost module in the VETravelPerformance package. Additional details speed smoothing A traffic management action or design that reduces the speed variation on freeways and arterials. Note that the introduction of autonomous vehicles will likely achieve this effect even when they only constitute a quarter or more of all vehicles on the roadway (Levin &amp; Boyles 2015, Mahmassani 2016). Thus, speed smoothing might become an important property of future traffic systems that analysts should include in future years even in spite of current local interest in such programs. Additional details transit modes VisionEval includes eight transit modes, which are also called transit service modes in some places in the documentation. The eight modes include demand-responsive (DR), vanpool and similar (VP), standard motor bus (MB), bus rapid transit and commuter bus (RB), monorail or other automated guideway (MG), streetcar or trolley bus (SR), light or heavy rail (HR), and commuter rail (CR) services. The latter includes specialized CR services such as hybrid rail, cable cars, and aerial tramways. Additional details transit service level User-supplied annual revenue miles of service for each of the eight transit modes are translated into bus-equivalents, revenue miles, and ultimately, vehicle miles. The transit service levels are set in the AssignTransitService module in the VETransportSupply package. Additional details transit service miles Bus-equivalent-miles used to compute transit service levels are summed to calculate transit miles by each transit mode. The calculations are carried out in the AssignTransitService module in the VETransportSupply package. Additional details transit vehicle type Different energy consumption and emissions characteristics are defined for vans, buses, and rail transit modes. Additional details travel demand management (TDM) Policies and programs used to discourage travel in single-occupant vehicles in order to achieve safer and more efficient multimodal transportation systems. TDM encompasses a wide variety of initiatives, to include promotion of active transport, public transportation modes, car and bike sharing, and telecommuting. Adjustments in household VMT due to TDM actions are coded in the BudgetHouseholdDvmt module in the VETravelPerformance package. Additional details urban mixed-use A mixed use development or neighborhood is one that includes residential and non-residential land uses in close proximity to one another, allowing for pedestrian access to many desired goods and services. Such places are walkable,bikeable, and encourage a local economy and strong social connections. From a transportation perspective such places are distinguished by their high degree of accessibility using non-motorized modes (active transport). In VisionEval the proportion of each Bzone that falls into this category can either be specified by the user or calculated by the program. If the latter a random sampling from an asserted distribution is used to define whether a household is in a mixed-use area. The density of the enclosing Bzone weights the probability of a household being so classified (i.e., the higher the density the higher probability of being assigned to a mixed-use neighborhood). These calculations are carried on in the CalculateUrbanMixMeasure module of the VEHouseholds package. Additional details urbanized area Collectively the urban location type portion of the metropolitan area (Marea) set of zones. The road, transit and urban mixed use variables only cover this portion of the Marea, which is typically equivalent to a Census urbanized area. value of time (VOT) The opportunity cost of the time that a person spends traveling rather than engaged in other activities. In theory it represents what the traveler would be willing to pay in order to reduce their time traveling. It is a surrogate for the value of travel times savings, which attempts to place a monetary value on the benefits of more efficient travel. While often an important parameter along with the equally influential value of reliability in pricing studies (Kockelman et al.Â 2013, Parsons Brinckerhoff et al.Â 2013) VOT is an average value in VisionEval. It is used in TimeCost calculations in the CalculateVehicleOperatingCost module. Additional details vehicle age The age of each household vehicle is estimated as a function of vehicle type (auto or light truck), household income, and the assumed average vehicle age coded for each vehicle type and Azone. The vehicle age is assigned in the AssignVehicleAge module in the VEHouseholdVehicles package. Additional details vehicle groups Different groups of vehicles are used in VisionEval by different types of users. Automobiles and light trucks are used by households, car service, and commercial service, and are assigned in the VEHouseholdVehicles package. Heavy trucks are treated separately, and three types of vehicles  vans, buses, and rail  are used for transit. Additional details vehicle hours of delay (VHD) An aggregate performance measure usually calculated by subtracting vehicle hours of travel under uncontested conditions from total vehicle hours of travel (VHT). Both measures are approximated for each metropolitan area in VisionEval in the CalculateRoadPerformance module of the VETravelPerformance package. Additional details vehicle operating costs see auto operating costs vehicle ownership costs see auto ownership costs vehicle table A vehicle table is a list of every vehicle owned by a household in VisionEval. It includes the vehicle characteristics, household ID, and the Azone and Marea the household is allocated to. It is created in the CreateVehicleTable module in the VEHouseholdVehicles package. Additional details vehicle type see vehicle groups "],["getting-started.html", "Chapter 2 Getting Started 2.1 Overview 2.2 Installation and Setup 2.3 Running VisionEval 2.4 Requirements", " Chapter 2 Getting Started 2.1 Overview The VisionEval software framework is written in the R programming language for statistical computing and graphics.

"],["verspm.html", "Chapter 3 VERSPM Tutorial 3.1 Overview 3.2 Inputs and Parameters 3.3 Modules and Outputs 3.4 Development and Installation", " Chapter 3 VERSPM Tutorial 3.1 Overview VERSPM is a strategic planning model that assists state and metropolitan area planners with the evaluation of transportation and land use policy scenarios. It considers a large number of factors which affect the performance of transportation systems and their effects on people and the environment. The Regional Strategic Planning Model (RSPM), was developed by the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) for the purpose of estimating and forecasting the effects of various policies and other influences on the amount of vehicle travel, the types of vehicles and fuels used, and the resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions among other outcomes. The VERSPM model was initially developed to address the following factors: Changes in population demographics (age structure); Changes in personal income; Relative amounts of development occurring in metropolitan, urban and rural areas; Metropolitan, other urban, and rural area densities; Urban form in metropolitan areas (proportion of population living in mixed use areas with a well interconnected street and walkway system); Amounts of metropolitan area transit service; Metropolitan freeway and arterial supplies; Auto and light truck proportions by year; Average vehicle fuel economy by vehicle type and year; Vehicle age distribution by vehicle type; Electric vehicles (EVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) Light-weight vehicles such as bicycles, electric bicycles, electric scooters, etc.; Pricing  fuel, vehicle miles traveled (VMT), parking; Demand management  employer-based and individual marketing; Car-sharing; Effects of congestion on fuel economy; Effects of incident management on fuel economy; Vehicle operation and maintenance  eco-driving, low rolling resistance tires, speed limits; Carbon intensity of fuels, including the well to wheels emissions; and Carbon production from the electric power that is generated to run electric vehicles. 3.1.1 Structure VERSPM is a disaggregate policy model that predicts travel demand impacts at an individual household level. The model estimates vehicle ownership, vehicle travel, fuel consumption, and GHG emissions at the individual household level. This structure accounts for the synergistic and antagonistic effects of multiple policies and factors (e.g.Â gas prices) on vehicle travel and emissions. For example, the battery range of electric vehicles (EVs) and plugin hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) is less of an issue for households residing in compact mixeduse neighborhoods because those households tend to drive fewer miles each day. Modeling at the household level makes it possible to evaluate the relationships between travel, emissions and the characteristics of households, land use, transportation systems, vehicles, and other factors. In addition, household level analysis makes it possible to evaluate the equitability of the costs and benefits of different strategies. The model comprises sequential steps with feedback. Each calculation step is composed of a number of calculations that operate on the results of the previous calculation step and on input data that reflect inputs. The VERSPM steps are grouped as follows: The iterative process to balance the VMT with travel costs allows congestion and other costs introduced at this step influence the amount of travel. This step balances the amount of household travel with the cost of travel and recalculates household VMT, Fuel &amp; GHG in the process. The primary outputs of the RSPM are household travel, fuel and power consumption, and GHG emissions calculations, but other information is produced for households and commercial vehicles as well. The amount of commercial (lightduty) and freight (heavy duty) travel is calculated as well as associated fuel, power consumption and GHG emissions for those vehicles. 3.1.2 Modules Household Modules - VESimHouseholds package The following four modules create a set of households for each forecast year that represents each resident in the model area with the likely household mix of household and person characteristics: Create Households Predict Workers Assign Life Cycle Predict Income Land Use Modules - VELandUse package The following five modules assigns a housing type to households (e.g.Â single-family, multi-family, etc.) and a development type (metropolitan, town, rural) based on available input dwelling units. Households are assigned a location in the metropolitan area based on the projected supply of housing and neighborhood affordability. Neighborhood population density and mixed-use character are calculated. Predict Housing Locate Employment Assign Location Types Calculate 4D Measures Calculate Urban Mix Measures The following three modules identifies parking restrictions and prices affecting households, identifies households participating in TDM programs and assigns car service availability to zones (including car sharing and taxis): Assign Parking Restrictions Assign Demand Management Assign Car Service Availability Transport Supply Modules - VETransportSupply package The following two modules gather details about the relevant roadway and public transport systems considered in the simulation of travel: Assign Transit Service Assign Road Miles Household Vehicle Modules - VEHouseholdVehicles package The following seven modules simulate details about the drivers of vehicles in the simulation and types of vehicles they drive: Assign Drivers Assign Vehicle Ownership Assign Vehicle Type Create Vehicle Table Assign Vehicle Age Calculate Vehicle Ownership Cost Adjust Vehicle Ownership Household Travel Modules - VEHouseholdTravel package The following four module provides an initial estimate of average daily vehicle miles traveled (DVMT) for each household based on the household characteristics (e.g., demographics, income, transportation options, and land use). They also calculate the households non-motorized trips. Calculate Household Daily Vehicle Miles Traveled Calculate Non-Automobile or Alternative Mode Trips Calculate Vehicle Trips Divert Single-occupant Vehicle Travel. Powertrain and Fuel Modules - VEPowertrainsAndFuels package The following two modules identifies the vehicles powertrain as an internal combustion engine (ICE), hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), or electric vehicle (EV) and calculates each household vehicles emission. Calculate Carbon Intensity Assign Household Vehicle Powertrains 3.1.3 Feedback THe next step balance the amount of household travel with the cost of travel and recalculate household VMT, Fuel and GHG emissions . This is necessary because: 1) congestion calculations affect fuel economy and thus the amount and cost of fuel consumed; 2) congestion pricing affects the amount of travel and household travel costs; 3) fuel, vehicle travel, and other taxes and fees affect the amount and cost of travel; and 4) eco-driving improves fuel economy and reduces fuel cost. The effect of these adjustments to household travel costs need to be included in the total household travel costs and the adjustment to household DVMT. Travel Performance - VETravelPerformance package The following modules run iteratively to balance the DVMT and travel costs. Total light duty vehicle (household and commercial service vehicle), truck and bus DVMT is calculated for the metropolitan area and assigned to portions of the road system (freeway, arterial, other). Congestion levels are and associated speed reductions are calculated considering the traffic loads and inputs regarding the deployment of traffic operations programs (e.g.Â ramp metering, traffic signal coordination) and congestion pricing. Speed-adjusted fuel economy is calculated considering variations by powertrain. Travel cost per mile due to congestion pricing is also calculated. Household travel costs are calculated from the amounts of miles driven, fuel consumed, electricity consumed, and GHG emitted. Other inputs establish the rates for fuel costs, power costs, fuel taxes, VMT taxes, PAYD insurance, and several external costs. Finally a household budget model is used to adjust household DVMT to reflect the effect of household travel costs on the amount of household travel. The adjusted household DVMT is allocated to vehicles in proportion to the previous allocation. This process can run multiple times until DVMT changes very little between iterations. Calculate Road VMT Calculate Road Performance; Calculate Fuel and Electric Energy Economy Adjust Fuel and Electric Energy Economy Calculate Vehicle Operating Cost Adjust DVMT Based on Budget Heavy Vehicles Emissions - VETravelPerformance The following two modules calculate heavy vehicle fuel and power consumption and GHG emissions: Calculate Commercial Vehicles Emissions Calculate Transit Vehicles Emissions 3.2 Inputs and Parameters The VERSPM model directory is organized with the following subdirectories: defs inputs results (created after a completed model run) scripts Generally speaking, the VERPSM inputs are classified into the five following categories: User input model parameters: These are input parameters (model or scenario specific), or model definition files, that users should review and modify as needed.

The model then assigns each household to a Bzone based on the households housing type and income quartile as well as the supply of housing by type and Bzone (an input), and the distribution of households by income quartile for each Bzone (an input). The module assigns non-institutional group quarters households to Bzones based on the supply of group quarters units by Bzone. User Input Files Dwelling Units (bzone_dwelling_units.csv) This file contains the number single-family dwelling units (SFDU), multifamily dwelling units (MFDU) and group-quarter dwelling units (GQDU) by Bzone for each of the base and future years. Data for the base year for single-family and multifamily dwelling units can be sourced from Census housing data with information on units in structure, with multifamily dwelling units defined as any structures with 2-or-more units. For group quarters, unless more detailed local data is available, Census data for non-institutionalized group quarter population can serve as a proxy for dwelling units assuming a 1:1 ratio of dwelling unit per GQ population.

For more information see here Top 3.3.13 AssignTransitService This module assigns transit service level to the metropolitan area (Marea) and neighborhoods (Bzones). Annual revenue-miles (i.e.Â transit miles in revenue service) by transit mode type are read from an input file. The following eight modes are recognized: * DR = Demand-responsive * VP = Vanpool and similar * MB = Standard motor bus * RB = Bus rapid transit and commuter bus * MG = Monorail/automated guideway * SR = Streetcar/trolley bus/inclined plain * HR = Heavy Rail/Light Rail * CR = Commuter Rail/Hybrid Rail/Cable Car/Aerial Tramway Revenue miles are converted to bus (i.e., MB) equivalents using factors derived from urbanized area data from the National Transit Database (NTD). Bus-equivalent revenue miles are used in models which predict vehicle ownership and household DVMT. Revenue miles by mode type are also translated (using NTD data) into vehicle miles by three vehicle types: van, bus, and rail.

The limit for each household is calculated in several steps. First, the proportion of the households income that may be spent on vehicle operating costs is calculated using a model that is explained below. This is called the budget proportion. Then an adjusted household income for budget calculation purposes is calculated by adding the annual cost of insurance for households subscribing to payd-as-you-drive (PAYD) insurance, cash-out parking payments for workers who work at an employer that has cash-out-buy-back parking, and any vehicle ownership cost savings for households that substitute high level car service for one or more household vehicles. The adjusted household income is muliplied by the budget proportion and divided by the average vehicle operating cost per mile for the household to determine the maximum household DVMT that fits within the household budget. The household DVMT is then set at the lesser of this budget maximum or the modeled household DVMT. The budget proportion model is estimated using data from the Bureau of Labors consumer expenditure survey for the years from 2003 to 2015. The data used are the nominal dollar expenditures by household income category and year by transportation category. The values for the operating cost categories (gas and oil, and maintenance and repair) are summed and then divided by the midpoint value for each income category to calculate the budget proportion for each income group and each year. From this the mean value is computed for each income group. The budget proportions for each income group and year are divided by the mean values by income group to normalize values. The standard deviation for the combined normalized values is computed and value of 3 deviations above the mean is set as the maximum normalized value. The mean values by income group are multiplied by this normalized maximum to derive a budget proportion maximum by income group. A smoothed splines model of the budget proportion as a function of income is then estimated from the calculated budget proportion maximums. This model is used to calculate the budget proportion for a household based on the household income. The minimum and maximum values of the calculated budget proportion maximums are used as constraints to avoid unreasonable results for very low incomes and very high incomes. 3.3.36.1 User Input Files This module does not have user-supplied input files 3.3.36.2 Internal Module Inputs Package Module Outputs Description VESimHouseholds CreateHouseholds HhId Household id VESimHouseholds CreateHouseholds HHSize Number of persons in the household VESimHouseholds PredictIncome Income Total annual income of household VELandUse AssignLocTypes LocType Location type (Urban, Town, Rural) of the place where the household resides VETravelPerformance CalculateVehicleOperatingCost AveVehCostPM Average out-of-pocket cost in dollars per mile of vehicle travel VEHouseholdVehicles AdjustVehicleOwnership OwnCostSavings Annual vehicle ownership cost (depreciation, finance, insurance, taxes) savings in dollars resulting from substituting the use of car services for a household vehicle VEHouseholdVehicles CalculateVehicleOwnCost HasPaydIns Identifies whether household has pay-as-you-drive insurance for vehicles: 1 = Yes, 0 = no VETravelPerformance CalculateVehicleOperatingCost AveGPM Average gasoline equivalent gallons per mile of household vehicle travel VETravelPerformance CalculateVehicleOperatingCost AveKWHPM Average kilowatt-hours per mile of household vehicle travel VETravelPerformance CalculateVehicleOperatingCost AveCO2ePM Average grams of carbon-dioxide equivalents produced per mile of household vehicle travel VELandUse AssignParkingRestrictions ParkingCost Daily cost for long-term parking (e.g.Â paid on monthly basis) VELandUse AssignParkingRestrictions IsCashOut Is worker paid parking in cash-out-buy-back program: 1 = yes, 0 = no VELandUse AssignParkingRestrictions PaysForParking Does worker pay for parking: 1 = yes, 0 = no VEHouseholdVehicles CalculateVehicleOwnCost InsCost Annual vehicle insurance cost in dollars 3.3.36.3 Module Outputs Dvmt: Average daily vehicle miles traveled by the household in autos or light trucks UrbanHhDvmt: Average daily vehicle miles traveled in autos or light trucks by households residing in the urbanized portion of the Marea RuralHhDvmt: Average daily vehicle miles traveled in autos or light trucks by households residing in the non-urbanized portion of the Marea DailyGGE: Gasoline equivalent gallons consumed per day by household vehicle travel DailyKWH: Kilowatt-hours consumed per day by household vehicle travel DailyCO2e: Grams of carbon-dioxide equivalents produced per day by household vehicle travel WalkTrips: Average number of walk trips per year by household members BikeTrips: Average number of bicycle trips per year by household members TransitTrips: Average number of public transit trips per year by household members VehicleTrips: Average number of vehicle trips per day by household members Top 3.3.37 CalculateComEnergyAndEmissions This module calculates the energy consumption and carbon emissions of heavy trucks and light-duty commercial service vehicles.

Both R and VisionEval are open source and freely available. For running VE-RSPM you need to follow these steps: Install R (users are encouraged to also install RStudio, a free and open-source integrated development environment for R) Install VisionEval Run VE-RSPM The VisionEval installer is available here. Follow the instructions on this page carefully to install the Visioneval on your system. 3.4.2 Running VE-RSPM Base Scenario 3.4.2.1 Preparing inputs Once VisionEval and VE-RSPM have been installed, a directory with sample data will be available at ../models/VERSPM/. (Note .. refers to the parent directory of the unzipped installer file). The VE-RSPM directory serves the dual purposes of providing sample data and serving as a template for local modification to other locations. The ../models/VERSPM/ directory contains sample input files for the Rogue Valley region in Oregon. These inputs can be modified or replaced to investigate the impacts of policy changes or to model a different region. The folder contains multiple files and subfolders: run_model.R is the core script for running the model. It consists of calls to the modules that make up the model. The user may modify the script to call the desired modules. The defs directory contains five model definition files which is introduced in Model Definition Files The inputs directory contains a number of CSV and JSON files that provide inputs for the modules. Each module specifies what input files it needs. If you would like to know the description of each input file and how you can change those files for your desired testing see Inputs_and_Parameters There is complete set of test data for RVMPO which you will find out in the VERSPM_base_model folder. You can use those data to test VERRSPM run. the ../models/VERSPM/ directory contains sample input files for RV MPO, Oregon. These can be modified or replaced to investigate the impacts of policy changes or to model a different region. To modify a scenario, the appropriate input files are edited. For example, to change the flat rate tax of vehicles for future azone_hh_veh_own_taxes.csv would be modified in Excel, LibreOffice, or a text editor to change the VehOwnFlatRateFee of year 2038 3.4.2.2 Running the Model There are multiple ways to run VisionEval models. VisionEval models can be run via the command line directly or using openModel, and can be run for one scenario or multiple scenarios in parallel. Results can be viewed in tabular form or with the interactive VEScenarioViewer. Start R (or RStudio) and make sure your directory is set to the installer folder. The easiest way to do this is to double-click VisionEval.Rproj, which will be associated with RStudio if that is installed correctly. You should see Welcome to VisionEval! on the RStudio console. Then run the following commands: rspmmod &lt;- openModel(&#39;VERSPM&#39;) rspmmod$run() By default this will run the model in ../models/VERSPM/ directory. The default model is for the Rouge Valley (Oregon) MPO, for 2010 and 2038. After running the script you will see how the modules will be running in order. The model run will take approximately 10-15 minutes. Once complete, the output are exported to ../models/VERSPM/outputs in 3 different zone levels. 3.4.3 Running VE-RSPM Multiple Scenarios Strategic planning often requires the assessment of large numbers of future scenarios, each assessing a different combination of prioritizations, policy decisions, and constraints. The VEScenarios module provides the capability to quickly set up, run, and visualize large numbers of VE-RSPM scenarios using a baseline scenario combined with multiple changes to model inputs. After going to ../models/VERSPM_Scenarios folder, you will see multiple subfolders and scripts. 3.4.3.0.1 VERSPM_base_model This directory contains the inputs and R script necessary to run the base scenario, as described above. 3.4.3.0.2 defs VE-RSPM_Scenarios/defs directory contains the same files as the VERSPM_base_model/defs directory, but the model_parameters.json file differs between VERSPM_base_model/defs andVE-RSPM_Scenarios/defs differs in that the latter version contains just four parameters specifying the locations of inputs and outputs, as well as the number of processors (NWorkers) to use. The default is 4, but be sure to set this to a number appropriate to your machine. [ { &quot;NAME&quot;: &quot;ModelFolder&quot;, &quot;VALUE&quot;: &quot;VERSPM_base_model&quot;, &quot;TYPE&quot;: &quot;character&quot;, &quot;UNITS&quot;: &quot;NA&quot;, &quot;PROHIBIT&quot;: &quot;NA&quot;, &quot;SIZE&quot;: 20, &quot;ISELEMENTOF&quot;: &quot;&quot; }, { &quot;NAME&quot;: &quot;ScenarioInputFolder&quot;, &quot;VALUE&quot;: &quot;scenario_inputs&quot;, &quot;TYPE&quot;: &quot;character&quot;, &quot;UNITS&quot;: &quot;NA&quot;, &quot;PROHIBIT&quot;: &quot;NA&quot;, &quot;SIZE&quot;: 20, &quot;ISELEMENTOF&quot;: &quot;&quot; }, { &quot;NAME&quot; : &quot;ScenarioOutputFolder&quot;, &quot;VALUE&quot;: &quot;scenarios&quot;, &quot;TYPE&quot;: &quot;character&quot;, &quot;UNITS&quot;: &quot;NA&quot;, &quot;PROHIBIT&quot;: &quot;NA&quot;, &quot;SIZE&quot;: 20, &quot;ISELEMENTOF&quot;: &quot;&quot; }, { &quot;NAME&quot; : &quot;NWorkers&quot;, &quot;VALUE&quot;: &quot;6&quot;, &quot;TYPE&quot; : &quot;integer&quot;, &quot;UNITS&quot; : &quot;NA&quot;, &quot;PROHIBIT&quot; : &quot;c(&#39;NA&#39;, &#39;&lt; 0&#39;)&quot;, &quot;ISELEMENTOF&quot; : &quot;&quot; } ] 3.4.3.0.3 Inputs The inputs folder in VERRSPM_Scenarios also differs from that in VERSPM_base_model. In this case, there is only a single file specifying the output data tables that should be exported as CSV files in the outputs directory. 3.4.3.0.4 scenario_inputs Model scenarios are defined in terms of combinations of individual model input parameters and policy choices. The various inputs are defined in the scenario_inputs folder. Scenario inputs consist of eleven folders, one for each of a particular category of input, as described below. All eleven folders are required. Within each folder, there are subfolders containing input files, one per specific input. Each of the folders must contain at least one subfolder named 1, defining the input for the base scenario. Subsequent numbered folders contain input files modifying parameters of interest, as shown in the screenshots below: Model inputs not otherwise specified in the scenario_inputs directory are drawn from files in VERSPM_base_model/defs and VERSPM_base_model/inputs The subfolder names and scenario inputs are defined as follows (input file to modify given in parentheses): B - Bicycles (azone_prop_sov_dvmt_diverted.csv) : Network improvements, incentives, and technologies that encourage bicycling and other light-weight vehicle travel 1 - Base bicycling percentage of SOV tours less than 20 miles (9.75%) 2 - Increase diversion of SOV tours to 20% C - Vehicle Travel Cost (azone_hh_veh_own_taxes.csv) and (region_prop_externalities_paid.csv) : Combination of fuel prices and charges to pay for roadway costs and possibly externalities 1 - No change in fuel prices or increase in roadway or externality charges 2 - Keep the vehicle ownership cost the same 3 - Higher climate cost and pay as you drive insurance D - DemandManagement (bzone_travel_demand_mgt.csv) : Programs to encourage less private vehicle travel 1 - Baseline implementation of ITS 2 - Increase the effectiveness of implementation of ITS E - Driving Efficiency (marea_operations_deployment.csv) and (marea_speed_smooth_ecodrive.csv) and (other_ops_effectiveness.csv) : Driving efficiency by increasing implementation of ITS 1 - Base 2 - Increased the proportion by 10% F - Technology Mix and CI (marea_transit_powertrain_prop.csv) and (region_carsvc_powertrain_prop.csv) and (region_comsvc_powertrain_prop.csv`) : Vehicle technology mix and carbon intensity of fuels. 1 - Baseline vehicle technology mix 2 - Increased percentage of electric vehicles in household and commercial setting by 20% G - Fuel Price (azone_fuel_power_cost.csv) : Real fuel price in 2010 USD 1 - Baseline fuel price 2 - Double fuel price 3 - Quadruple fuel price I - Income (azone_fuel_power_cost.csv) : Real average household income in 2010 USD 1 - Baseline household income 2 - Income growth of 7% w.r.t reference 3 - Income growth of 14% w.r.t reference L - LandUse (azone_hhsize_targets.csv) and (bzone_urban_du_proportions.csv) : Distribution of population and employment by place type 1 - Base, Maintain current distribution 2 - LU overlaps with HHsize + Population P - Parking (bzone_parking.csv) : The extent of paid parking and its price 1 - Current extent and daily fee 2 - Increase parking cost by 100% and proportion charted by 10%. T - Transit (marea_transit_service.csv) : The extent and frequency of transit service 1 - Current public transit service level 2 - Double public transit service level 3 - Quadruple public transit service level V - Vehicle Characteristics (azone_hh_veh_mean_age.csv) and (azone_lttrk_prop): The combination of fuel prices and vehicle travel charges to pay for roadways and to pay for externalities such as carbon pricing 1 - Base 2 - Light truck proportion at 35% of the fleet and the average vehicle age at 8 years Running all of these input values will result in 10368 total scenarios, which would take days to run. User usually does not need all the possible combinations of scenarios. VE-RSPM Scenarios are grouped in 5 different categories which you can modify in category_config.json : Community Design : Policies that seek to enable shorter trips and alternate modes such as promotion of mixed use land use, transit service, bicycling, and parking management. ( group of L, B, P , T ) Marketing/Incentive : Policies that improve driving efficiency such as ecodriving,and Intelligent Transportation System efforts, as well as programs that reduce auto demand such as carsharing, and home or work-based transportation demand management.( group of D, E ) Pricing : Policies that move towards true cost pricing such as road user fees to pay for the cost of operating, maintaining and improving roads, pay-as-you-drive (PAYD) insurance, and environmental impact fees such as a carbon tax. ( C ) Vehicles/Fuels : Factors representing changes to future vehicles and fuels ( group of V, F ) Income : Context factor on the assumed growth of statewide average per capita income ( I ) Depending on how many scenarios exist in each of these five groups, total number of scenarios will be determined. To test the multi-scenario capability in less time, reduce the number of scenario inputs by deleting some of the numbered folders, making sure to retain the 1 folder for each of the six options. Note that if you change the directory structure in scenario_inputs, you will have to change category_config.json and scenario_config.json to match the new directory structure. To modify the scenario inputs, the numbered subdirectories can be created or deleted. Each directory contains a single input file containing the modified model parameter. 3.4.3.0.5 Running the model for multiple scenarios Similar to base case the model can be run in the command line. To run the model using R, run the following commands: scenario_rspm &lt;- openModel(&#39;VERSPM_Scenarios&#39;) scenario_rspm$run() After starting the run,model automatically builds scenarios by creating all possible combinations of settings found in scenario_inputs. The scenarios to run are found in the newly created scenarios directory. Each directory is essentially a copy of VERSPM_base_model, with inputs modified as specified in the scenario_inputs directory. Each scenario directory contains the results of a model run with its own inputs, datastore, and log file. When finished, the VE-RSPM Scenario Viewer will automatically open to display the results. To find out more on exported metrics see Performance Metrics In detail, the model specified by the run_model.R script. In this case, the script runs four modules that create the scenarios from the inputs, runs each and combines the results. Return to Tutorial. ## Performance Metrics A large number of performance metrics are produced during the run of the RPAT model, including environment and energy impacts, financial and economic impacts, and community impacts. The full list of outputs available is as follows.

land use or policies and view their effects on model outputs, and the process can also be reversed, allowing users to choose desired outcomes and view the policy scenarios that reflect those outcomes. Instructions for using the viewer are built in to the page itself. To access a condensed version of the instructions, click on the Quick Start button at the top of the page. To understand more detail on the available categories of inputs and their levels as well as more detailed descriptions of the model output shown in the bar charts you can click on Detailed Instructions button To see which policy choices and land use inputs result in desired outcomes, select a range of values within one outcome. In this case, the low end of the DVMT per capita has been chosen: As the outcome is selected, the bar graphs and the data table at the bottom (not shown) update to show only the scenarios resulting in the selected outcome. For instance, In this case, the low end of DVMT per capita are associated with the most increase in fuel price or more public transit and parking costs for community design. It is also possible to select inputs to view the associated outcomes. To do so, simply click on the bar corresponding to the desired scenario input. In this case (below) the scenario with highest fuel price is selected to view the impacts on outcome variables Here, DVMT per capita and annual fuel cost digrams shift to the left as expected since less people are expected to drive in this scenario Return to Tutorial. "],["verpat-tutorial.html", "Chapter 4 VERPAT Tutorial 4.1 Overview 4.2 Inputs and Parameters 4.3 Modules and Outputs", " Chapter 4 VERPAT Tutorial 4.1 Overview VERPAT is a tool for evaluating the impact of various smart growth policies. VERPAT is designed to be a high-level evaluation at a regional scale that can bridge the distance between evaluating smart growth policies during a regional visioning process and evaluating smart growth policies at a project or alternative level in a regional transportation plan. VERPAT evaluates policy scenarios to identify the most promising policies that could be further tested using a more detailed project-level tool. Currently, VERPAT can provide information on the following changes in the regional system: Built Environment - changes to the urban form (proportion of population and employment living in mixed-use areas, transit-oriented developments, or rural/greenfield areas) Travel Demand - changes in population demographics (age structure), changes in personal income, changes in firms by size or industry, relative amounts of development occurring in urban core, close-in communities, suburban or rural areas, urban core, auto and light truck proportions by year, and induced demand Transportation Supply - amounts of regional transit service, amounts of freeway and arterial capacity Policies - pricing (vehicle miles traveled charges or parking pricing programs), intelligent transportation system (ITS) strategies for freeways and arterials, demand management (vanpool, telecommuting, ridesharing, and transit pass programs) VERPAT is designed to evaluate regions, which can be a multi-county metropolitan region. It distinguishes between population and employment living/working in the urban core, close-in communities, suburban and rural/greenfield areas based on densities, diversity in land uses, street design or intersection densities, job accessibility by auto, distances to transit stops, and connectivity of the street system. The intended audience for VERPAT is regional decision-makers and land use and transportation planners involved in the development and evaluation of transportation and land use policies, and who need to conduct scenario planning to evaluate smart growth policies and determine their impact on travel demand. VERPAT was designed to address as many of the limitations identified in the research as possible and to provide a tool that filled a gap in the set of available tools. The relationships in the VERPAT tool were based upon the background research conducted for the SHRP 2 C16 project. VERPAT is designed to allow the evaluation of a wide range of policies and combination of policies in a consistent framework quickly and easily so that promising smart growth strategies can be identified and pursued in the land use and transportation planning processes. VERPAT is intended to precede and supplement more sophisticated modeling efforts, which can be used to evaluate specific smart growth projects. It is designed to be accessible to land use and transportation planners with no modeling experience. 4.1.1 VERPAT Model Structure VERPAT is a disaggregate policy model that predicts travel demand impacts at an individual household level. The diagram below illustrates the modeling system with model components and feedback loops. Links are provided to the source code that implements each section. Household Models: Households Package Firms Models: Firms Package Urban Form Models: Land Use Package Accessibility Models: Transport Supply Package Vehicle Models: Household Vehicles Package Travel Demand Models: Household Travel Package Congestion Models: Transport Supply Use Package Travel Performance Package Reporting Package For more, see [[VERPAT Modules and Outputs | VERPAT-Modules-and-Outputs]]. 4.1.2 VERPAT Modules VERPAT does not provide specific spatial results beyond the built environment categories at the regional level, but does capture individual household and firm characteristics and the interactions between policies. The disaggregate nature of the model captures impacts that may be occurring for small portions of the population (say 0-vehicle households) where aggregate models have a more difficult time capturing these impacts. The following is an explanation of major steps in the model execution [] = indicates VE modules Household Model - Households Package Create synthetic households for the region, including persons [Create Households] and workers [Predict Workers] by age group. A total household income is assigned to each household, given the ages of persons in the household and the average per capita income of the region where the household resides [PredictIncome]. Firm Model - Synthetic Firms Package A set of firms is created for each forecast year that represents the likely firm composition for the region, given the County Business Pattern data of firms by size and industry. Each firm is described in terms of the number of employees and its industry [CreateBaseSyntheticFirms] and [CreateFutureSyntheticFirms]. Urban Form Model - Land Use Package Calculate Place Types for Households and Firms - Population and employment location characteristics are important variables in the vehicle ownership, travel demand, and accessibility models. There are four place types (urban core, Close-in Community, suburban, and rural and five location categories (residential, commercial, mixed-use, transit-oriented development, and Greenfield)]. Models for households were developed to estimate location characteristics using National Household Travel Survey data. Firms are currently allocated randomly to fit the employment allocation inputs since there are no national datasets from which to draw these relationships [CalculateBasePlaceTypes] and [CalculateFuturePlaceTypes]. Accessibility Model - Transport Supply Package Calculate Freeway, Arterial, and Public Transit Supply Levels - The number of lane miles of freeways and arterials is computed for each region based on the change in inventories for a particular scenario. For public transit, the inputs specify the change in transit revenue miles relative to the base. Inputs for each area also specify the revenue mile split between electrified rail and buses [CreateBaseAccessibility] and [CreateFutureAccessibility]. Vehicle Model - Household Vehicle Package Calculate Vehicle Ownership - Each household is assigned the number of vehicles it is likely to own based on the number of persons of driving age in the household, whether only elderly persons live in the household, the income of the household, the population density where the household lives, the freeway supply, the transit supply, and whether the household is located in an urban mixed-use area. [AssignVehicleFeatures] and [AssignVehicleFeaturesFuture]. Travel Demand Model - Household Travel Package Calculate Travel Demand - The average daily vehicle miles traveled, classification of vehicles as electric vehicles, auto and transit trips for each household is modeled based on household information determined in previous steps for the base conditions. The model is sensitive to household income, population density of the neighborhood where the household resides, number of household vehicles, whether the household owns no vehicles, the levels of public transportation and freeway supplies in the region, the driving age population in the household, the presence of persons over age 65, and whether the neighborhood is characterized by mixed-use development. [CalculateTravelDemand] and [CalculateTravelDemandFuture]. Calculate Truck and Bus Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) - Regional truck VMT is calculated based on changes in the regional household income. As a default, a one-to-one relationship between regional income growth and truck VMT growth is assumed. In other words, a doubling of total regional income would result in a doubling of truck VMT. Bus VMT is calculated from bus revenue miles that are factored up to total vehicle miles to account for miles driven in non-revenue service. [[CalculateTravelDemand](https://github.com/visioneval/VisionEval/wiki/VERPAT-Modules-and-Outputs#calculatetraveldemand)] and [[CalculateTravelDemandFuture](https://github.com/visioneval/VisionEval/wiki/VERPAT-Modules-and-Outputs#calculatetraveldemandfuture)]. Congestion Model - Transport Supply Use Package Calculate the amount of congestion  Auto, and light truck VMT, truck VMT and bus VMT are allocated to freeways, arterials, and other roadways. Truck and bus VMT are allocated based on mode-specific data, and auto and light truck VMT are allocated based on a combination of factors and a model that is sensitive to the relative supplies of freeway and arterial lane miles. System-wide ratios of VMT to lane miles for freeways and arterials are used to allocate VMT to congestion levels using congestion levels defined by the Texas Transportation Institute for the Urban Mobility Report. Each freeway and arterial congestion level is associated with an average trip speed for conditions that do and do not include ITS treatment for incident management on the roadway. Overall average speeds by congestion level are calculated based on input assumptions about the degree of incident management. Speed vs.Â fuel efficiency relationships for light vehicles, trucks, and buses are used to adjust the fleet fuel efficiency averages computed for the region. [CalculateCongestionBase], [CalculateCongestionFuture], and [CalculateCongestionPolicy]. 4.1.3 Feedback loops Following initial calculations for baseline conditions, the model has feedback loops, which allow for changes in travel demand and other impacts based on induced travel demand and for changes in policies for a given scenario. Congestion is recalculated following these adjustments to demand. Induced Demand Model - Household Travel Package Calculate Induced Travel Demand - Induced demand is calculated for changes in roadway supply in the near term as a function of speed, based on potential mode and route shifts to produce changes in VMT and in the longer term to include changes in vehicle ownership, still as a function of speed. This model does not include induced demand as a result of changes in growth that may occur as part of a smart growth scenario because the evidence is limited empirical evidence. [CalculateInducedDemand]. Policy Adjusted Travel Demand - Household Travel Package Calculate Scenario Travel Demand - The average daily VMT for each household can be adjusted based on changes in growth patterns by place type, changes in auto operating cost, changes in road lane miles or transit revenue miles for any scenario. There are also a series of policy assumptions that can contribute to changes in VMT: pricing such as VMT charges or parking pricing, ITS strategies for freeways and arterials, and vanpool, telecommuting, ridesharing, and transit pass programs. All of these will contribute to shifts in travel demand for a given scenario. [CalculatePolicyVmt]. Performance metrics are calculated in the VEReports package. The other impacts that are produced for a given scenario include environment and energy impacts greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fuel consumption), financial and economic impacts (highway and transit infrastructure costs, transit operating costs, and traveler costs), regional accessibility, and community impacts (livability and public health indicators). 4.1.4 For more information VERPAT Modules and Outputs VisionEval Model System Design and Users Guide TravelWorks Rapid Policy Assessment Tool RPAT User manual [[Overview | VERPAT-Tutorial-Overview]] 4.2 Inputs and Parameters VERPAT contains 5 definition files and 32 input files, some of which the user must change and others which typically remain unchanged.

One emerging school of thought in land use planning is to consider land uses in terms of place types instead of simply residential or commercial or high density compared to low density. A place type refers to all of the characteristics of a developed area including the types of uses included, the mix of uses, the density and intensity of uses. URBAN CORE CLOSE-IN COMMUNITY SUBURBAN RURAL Residential Commercial Mixed-Use Transit-Oriented Development Rural/Greenfield An initial typology or system to organize place types can be traced to the Smart Growth Transect, which contained six zones in its original configuration including: Rural Preserve Rural Reserve Edge General Center Core This approach to classifying place types was further refined in the Caltrans Smart Mobility which defined the following seven place types including: Urban Centers Close-In Compact Communities Compact Communities Suburban Communities Rural and Agricultural Lands Protected Lands Special Use Areas Several of these place type categories provided additional options such as the Close-In Compact Communities which had three sub-definitions including Close-In-Centers, Close-In Corridors, and Close-In Neighborhoods. An alternative view of place types was provided by Reconnecting America, which developed a performance based place type approach for describing areas proximate to transit stations. Station areas would vary in terms of their relative focus between residential units, employees or a mix of the two. Station areas are also characterized on their relative intensity as well as shown below. PERFORMANCE BASED TYPOLOGY FOR TRANSIT STATION AREAS The approach employed for the place types in RPAT is therefore an amalgam of these approaches, in that the terminology is borrowed from the Smart Growth Transect and Caltrans Smart Mobility Study, while the relative performance of each place type is taken from the Reconnecting America approach but applied to a region instead of transit station sites. Four general area types are defined in RPAT including: The Urban Core is the high-density mixed-use places with high jobs-housing ratios, well connected streets and high levels of pedestrian activities. It is anticipated that for many regions, the Urban Core will be the traditional downtown area of which there likely would be only one. The Close-in Community would be those areas located near to the Urban Cores and would consist primarily of housing with scattered mixed-use centers and arterial corridors. Housing would be varied in terms of density and type. Transit would be available with a primary focus on commute trips. These areas may be classified by their residents as suburban would be considered to be close-in communities given their adjacency to the Downtown and therefore the higher levels of regional accessibility. The Suburban place type is anticipated to represent the majority of development within regions. These communities are characterized by low level of integration of housing with jobs, retail, and services, poorly connected street networks, low levels of transit service, large amounts of surface parking, and limited walk ability. The Rural place type is defined as settlements of widely spaced towns separated by firms, vineyards, orchards, or grazing lands. These areas would be characterized by widely dispersed residential uses, little or no transit service, and very limited pedestrian facilities. Further definition of the place types is allowed through the use of development types within the Urban Core, Close-in Community, and Suburban area types including: Residential includes all place types that are predominantly residential in character with limited employment and retail opportunities. Examples of this development type might include typical Suburban Residential or areas of the Downtown which are primarily residential as well. It is anticipated that this development type may be found in all of the area types except for rural. Employment includes those areas which are focused on employment with limited retail and residential. An example of this might include a Suburban Office Complex or a large cluster of office buildings within a Close-in Community or Urban Core. As with the residential development type, it is anticipated that this type of use would be found in all place types except for rural. Mixed-Use are those areas within a region which have a mix of residential, employment, and retail uses. While this development type can be found in the Suburban place type, it is most commonly found in the close-in community and urban core place type. Downtown areas that have retained their residential population to complement the employment are examples of this development type. Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) which is similar to the other development types in that it is applied to all area types except for Rural areas since it is thought to be highly unlikely that a rural TOD would be developed. The TOD development type is characterized by greater access to transit in all area types. Examples of this development type might include a Suburban TOD focused on a commuter rail station. The process of allocating existing land use to the 13 place types is somewhat dependent on the types of data available in a region that describe existing land use, and the process can be either very detailed or somewhat simplified. The following description relays the process developed by Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) as part of the pilot testing of RPAT and provides an example of how, mechanically, an agency can approach this allocation. It should be noted that this is merely one approach and not a specific recommendation for a method that should be followed. In general, ARC followed a somewhat detailed process to derive input data from land use data as presented in their Unified Growth Policy Map, and from their regional travel demand model. They developed heuristics to align their land use with the 13 place types that RPAT uses. The conversion of land use data to the place type scheme used in RPAT involved taking ARCs Unified Growth Policy Map (UGPM) Areas and converting them to the 13 RPAT place types. The first step was to allocate the UGPM areas to the four area types used in RPAT. The Urban Core area type includes Region Core, Region Employment Centers and Aerotropolis UGPM areas; Close-in Community includes Maturing Neighborhoods; Suburban includes Developing Suburbs and Established Suburbs; and Rural includes Rural Areas and Developing Rural. The ARC traffic analysis zone (TAZ) system was overlaid with the area types and the centroid of the TAZ was used to determine its area type. The RPAT development type, the other dimension of the place type matrix, which included residential, mixed-use, employment, and TOD development types was determined for each TAZ not in the rural area type using the base year percentage of the TAZs employment in relation to the total of the population and employment in the TAZ. The mix between the employment and employment was used to determine the TAZs development type using the following cut points: Residential: &lt; 33.33% Mixed Use: 33.33% to 66.67% Employment: &gt; 66.67% Identify any TAZs that are TOD based on transit service and specific development types: only one TAZ was determined to be TOD as a development type, Lindbergh Center, in the Urban Core area type. The combination of the area type and the development type was then used to allocate all TAZs to one of the 13 place types. The following is an enumeration of each place type abbreviation as it appears in the input file as well as a brief description of that value: Abbreviation Description Rur Rural Sub_R Suburban Residential Sub_E Suburban Employment (i.e.Â Commercial) Sub_M Suburban Mixed Use Sub_T Suburban Transit Oriented Development CIC_R Close-in Community Residential CIC_E Close-in Community Employment (i.e.Â Commercial) CIC_M Close-in Community Mixed Use CIC_T Close-in Community Transit Oriented Development UC_R Urban Core Residential UC_E Urban Core Employment (i.e.Â Commercial) UC_M Urban Core Mixed Use UC_T Urban Core Transit Oriented Development Inputs Model Parameters Definitions 4.2.1 units.csv The units.csv file describes the default units to be used for storing complex data types in the model.

See this explanation for more infomation regarding place types. Each column, for each year, must sum to one (1). It is acceptable to have no land use (i.e.Â a value of 0) in certain categories. The yearly TAZ employment and population totals were summed by the 13 place type and then scaled to total one for both employment and population. The allocation of growth between the base and the future years in population and employment to each of the 13 place types is captured by the rows containing future years. The discussion of the population and jobs by place type input above describes how to allocate existing land use to the 13 place types. A similar approach can be used to allocate expected growth from spatial planning resources such as TAZ or Census Block Group level forecasts to the place types.

The consistency in the naming of the region should be maintained across all the files that contains the label county or Geo. It is also not necessary to use such detailed NAICS categories if those are not available; the current business synthesis model and subsequent models do not use this level of detail (although future versions of the model may)  at minimum, the number of establishments for all employment types can be provided by size category. Regions with significant employment in industries such as government and public administration that are not covered by the CBP may need to add records to the file that cover this type of employment to more accurately match employment totals in their region.

The file includes one row for bus VMT data and one row for Truck VMT data. It should be noted that it is not necessary to enter values in the PropVmt column for BusVmt as this is calculated using the values in the transportation_supply.csv #EDIT (marea_rev_miles_pc.csv?) user input file. The truck VMT proportion (PropVMT column, TruckVMT row) can be obtained from Highway Performance Monitoring System data and local sources or the regional travel demand model if one exists. The proportions of VMT by functional class can be derived from the Federal Highway Cost Allocation Study and data from transit operators. The Federal Highway Cost Allocation Study (Table II-6, 1997 Federal Highway Cost Allocation Study Final Report, Chapter II is used to calculate the average proportion of truck VMT by functional class.

Values entered should be between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating that 100% of road miles are treated. The ITS policy measures the effects of incident management supported by ITS. The ITS table is used to inform the congestion model and the travel demand model. The model uses the mean speeds with and without incidents to compute an overall average speed by road type and congestion level providing a simple level of sensitivity to the potential effects of incident management programs on delay and emissions. The ITS treatments are evaluated only on freeways and arterials. The ITS treatments that can be evaluated are those that the analyst considers will reduce non-recurring congestion due to incidents. This policy does not deal with other operational improvements such as signal coordination, or temporary capacity increases such as allowing shoulder use in the peak.

In VERPAT, non-motorized vehicles are bicycles, and also electric bicycles, segways, and similar vehicles that are small, light-weight and can travel at bicycle speeds or slightly higher. The parameters are as follows: TargetProp: non-motorized vehicle ownership rate (average ratio of non-motorized vehicles to driver age population) Threshold: single-occupant vehicle (SOV) tour mileage threshold used in the SOV travel proportion model. This is the upper limit for tour lengths that are suitable for reallocation to non-motorized modes. PropSuitable: proportion of SOV travel suitable for non-motorized vehicle travel. This variable describes the proportion of SOV tours within the mileage threshold for which non-motorized vehicles might be substituted. This variable takes into account such factors as weather and trip purpose. The non-motorized vehicle model predicts the ownership and use of non-motorized vehicles (where non-motorized vehicles are bicycles, and also electric bicycles, segways and similar vehicles that are small, light-weight and can travel at bicycle speeds or slightly higher than bicycle speeds). The core concept of the model is that non-motorized vehicle usage will primarily be a substitute for short-distance SOV travel. Therefore, the model estimates the proportion of the household vehicle travel that occurs in short-distance SOV tours. The model determines the maximum potential for household VMT to be diverted to non-motorized vehicles, which is also dependent on the availability of non-motorized vehicles. Note that bike share programs (BSP) serve to increase the availability of non-motorized vehicles and can be taken into account by increasing the TargetProp variable. Use national estimates of non-motorized ownership if regional estimates of non-motorized ownership are not available (unless the region has notably atypical levels of bicycle usage). See Bicycle Ownership in the United States for an analysis of regional differences.

The input parameters are as follows and should be entered for both the base and future year: PropWorkParking: proportion of employees that park at work PropWorkCharged: proportion of employers that charge for parking PropCashOut: proportion of employment parking that is converted from being free to pay under a cash-out buy-back type of program PropOtherCharged: proportion of other parking that is not free ParkingCost.2000: average daily parking cost in 2000 year USD. In order to use base year dollars just replace 2000 in column labels with base year. This variable is the average daily parking cost for those who incur a fee to park. If the paid parking varies across the region, then the PkgCost value should reflect the average of those parking fees, but weighted by the supply  so if most parking is in the Center City, then the average will be heavily weighted toward the price in the Center City.

By default, the transportation supply is assumed to grow in line with population increase; therefore a value of 1 indicates growth in proportion with population growth. A value less than 1 indicates that there will be less freeway lane mile supply, per person, in the future. A value of 1 indicates faster freeway expansion than population growth.

These changes are interpreted as changes in design (intersection street density), accessibility (job accessibility by auto), distance to transit (nearest transit stop), density (population density) and diversity (land use mix). The effect on travel demand is determined as changes in VMT by these urban form categories, as shown in the table below. The elasticities that are shown in the table are multiplied by the D values for each place type. The D values are proportion values for each place type that are relative to the regional average, which is set to 1.0. VehicleTrips  The change in the number of vehicle trips is calculated using a set of elasticities from Index 4D Values (2001) that pivots from the current number of vehicle trips per capita based on the scenarios allocation of growth by place type. The elasticities shown in the table are applied to D values, which are proportional values for each place type that are relative to a regional average for that D value that is set to 1.0. The model reports the additional number of trips caused by the growth assumed in the scenario and not the regional total. TransitTrips  The change in the number of transit trips is calculated using a set of elasticities from Index 4D Values (2001) that pivots from the current number of transit trips per capita based on the scenarios allocation of growth by place type. The elasticities shown in the table are applied to D values, which are proportional values for each place type that are relative to a regional average for that D value that is set to 1.0. The model reports the additional number of trips caused by the growth assumed in the scenario and not the regional total. Walking  The elasticities shown in the table are applied to D values, which are proportional values for each place type that are relative to a regional average for that D value that is set to 1.0. The product of the elasticity and D value is applied to the place type growth quantities for the scenario to calculated the percentage increase or decrease in walking for new residents in the region relative to a the current place type distribution.

The proportion of employees participating in the ridesharing program is a policy input. This is converted into a proportion of working-age persons by using an assumed labor force participation rate (0.65) to sample working-age persons in households. The ridesharing sub-model then computes the anticipated level of VMT reduction resulting from the implementation of ridesharing, based on the place type the household lives in, using the effectiveness values shown in this parameter file. Previous studies have determined that the level of ridesharing participation will be less in the rural and suburban areas, as compared to the more-urban areas. Typically, more people will carpool in the more urbanized areas due to the presence of parking charges, potential difficulties in finding parking, and other disincentives that are typically present in more urbanized areas.

The subsidized/discounted transit model begins by evaluating the level of participation within the region. Monte Carlo processes are used to identify which households participate in transit pass programs. The proportion of employees participating in this program is a policy input. This is converted into a proportion of working-age persons by using an assumed labor force participation rate (0.65) to sample working-age persons in households. The model then allows the selection of one of four potential subsidy levels (also a policy inputs), which influence the level of VMT reduction based on the level of subsidy applied to the place type.

The vanpool program sub-model operates by evaluating the likely level of participation. Monte Carlo processes are used to identify which households participate in vanpool programs. The proportion of employees participating in this program is a policy input. This is converted into a proportion of working-age persons by using an assumed labor force participation rate (0.65) to sample working-age persons in households. Those employers that would participate in the program are then categorized into three levels of involvement from low to medium to high. The level of involvement reflects the extent to which an employer would actively facilitate and promote vanpooling. For example, a low level of involvement might represent an employer who organizes only a minimal number of vanpools. The high level of involvement could represent an employer who has an extensive vanpooling program to cover a large number of employees. Based on the level of involvement, the reduction in VMT is estimated on the basis of the values in this file.

The telecommuting or alternative work schedule model first evaluates the likely level of participation throughout the region in terms of telecommuting or alternatively-works schedules. Monte Carlo processes are used to identify which households participate in telecommuting programs. The proportion of employees participating in this program is a policy input. This is converted into a proportion of working-age persons by using an assumed labor force participation rate (0.65) to sample working-age persons in households. The model then determines the type of programs that might be implemented. Three potential alternatives are offered including: 4/40 Schedule: 4 days per week with 40 hours per week 9/80 Schedule: working 4 days every other week with an average of 80 hours over 2 weeks Telecommuting: Workers may work 1 to 2 days a week remotely Once the option has been identified and the level of participation, the estimated VMT is determined on the basis of the parameters in this file.

The parameters are used in the calculations of the transportation costs performance metrics. The source for transit capital, operating costs, and fare revenue is the NTD, and in particular the National Transit Profile which is available on the NTDB website. Costs are available in a variety of index formats, e.g.Â cost per revenue mile or hour; cost per passenger trip is used in VERPAT. The source for highway infrastructure costs is FHWAs Highway Economic Requirements System model, or HERS. Information was obtained from Chapter 6 of the 2005 Technical Report for all US states (FHWA, 2005). Table 8-1 in HERS provides unit costs (per lane mile) for both Rural and Urban highway systems, and distinguishes among three functional classes: interstates, freeways and expressways; other principal arterials; and minor arterials and collectors. Costs estimates are provided for the following improvements: Reconstruction and widening Reconstruct pavement Resurface and widen lanes Resurface pavement Improve shoulders Additional choices are offered to distinguish between adding a lane at normal vs.Â high cost, and also for pavement realignment, also under normal vs.Â high cost conditions. For practical reasons, it was decided to use only new construction (which also includes adding lanes) costs as the basis for the cost estimates, and to ignore the categories of reconstruction, resurfacing, and realignment. These construction costs include right of way, construction, and a small allowance for bridges and support facilities. The infrastructure costs focus only on the urban system, not rural, which also makes it possible to differentiate by three size classes: Small Urban, Small Urbanized, and Large Urbanized. The numbers from HERS are in 2002 dollars; FHWA advises escalation to current dollars using its NHCCI, which is available online at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/nhcci.cfm); the report in VERPAT escalates uses this Index to escalate to 2010 values. The parameter values in this file are average values per lane mile, simplifying the calculations of highway costs to just differentiate investments in freeway vs.Â arterial functional class roads.

It is a simple model which predicts workers as a function of the household type and age composition. There is no responsiveness to jobs or how changes in the job market and demographics might change the worker age composition, but the user can exogenously adjust the relative employment by age group, Azone, and year. The values are the proportions of persons in the age group who are workers relative to the proportions in the estimation year. 4.3.2.1 User Input Files Relative employment (azone_relative_employment.csv): This file contains ratio of workers to persons by age cohort in model year vs.Â estimation data year.

The data can be obtained from the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis for the current year or from regional or state sources for forecast years. In order to use current year dollars just replace 2000 in column labels with current year. For example, if the data is obtained in year 2005 dollars then the column labels in the file shown below will become HHIncomePC.2005 and GQIncomePC.2005.

Each firm is described in terms of the number of employees and its industry. 4.3.4.1 User Input Files Employment (azone_employment_by_naics.csv): This file contains employment data for each of the counties that make up the region. The file is derived from County Business Pattern (CBP) data by county. Industries are categorized by the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) 6 digit codes. Firm size categories are: n1_4: 1- 4 employees n5_9: 5-9 employees n10_19: 10-19 employees n20_99: 20-99 employees n100_249: 100-249 employees n250_499: 250-499 employees n500_999: 500-999 employees n1000: 1,000 or More Employee Size Class n1000_1: 1,000-1,499 employees n1000_2: 1,500-2,499 employees n1000_3: 2,500 to 4, 999 Employees n1000_4: Over 5,000 employees While the county field is required to be present, the business synthesis process does not require a meaningful value and therefore users may simply enter region. The consistency in the naming of the region should be maintained across all the files that contains the label county or Geo. It is also not necessary to use such detailed NAICS categories if those are not available; the current business synthesis model and subsequent models do not use this level of detail (although future versions of the model may) - at minimum, the number of establishments for all employment types can be provided by size category. Regions with significant employment in industries such as government and public administration that are not covered by the CBP may need to add records to the file that cover this type of employment to more accurately match employment totals in their region. The two additional fields contained in the file are: emp: Total number of employees est: Total number of establishments Here is the snapshot of the file: county year naics emp est n1_4 n5_9 n10_19 n20_49 n50_99 n100_249 n250_499 n500_999 n1000 n1000_1 n1000_2 n1000_3 n1000_4 Multnomah 2005 113110 0 5 2 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Multnomah 2005 113310 0 3 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Multnomah 2005 114111 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Multnomah 2005 114112 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Multnomah 2005 115114 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 Multnomah 2005 115210 0 4 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Multnomah 2005 115310 0 5 2 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Multnomah 2005 212319 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Multnomah 2005 212321 0 4 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4.3.4.2 Module Outputs naics: The six digit naics code esizecat: The employment size category numbus: The number of businesses emp: The number of employees in a business Top Definitions Inputs/Outputs 4.3.5 CreateFutureSyntheticFirms This module creates a set of firms for future year that represents the likely firm composition for the region, given the County Business Pattern data of firms by size and industry. Each firm is described in terms of the number of employees and its industry. 4.3.5.1 User Input Parameters Employment Growth (EmploymentGrowth): This variable represents a growth rate for employment in the region between the base year and the future year. A rate of 1 indicates no changes in overall employment, a value of more than 1 indicates some growth (e.g., 1.5 = 50% growth) and a value of less than 1 indicates decline in employment. It should be defined in model_parameters.json as follows: { &quot;NAME&quot;: &quot;EmploymentGrowth&quot;, &quot;VALUE&quot;: &quot;1.5&quot;, &quot;TYPE&quot;: &quot;double&quot;, &quot;UNITS&quot;: &quot;multiplier&quot;, &quot;PROHIBIT&quot;: &quot;&quot;, &quot;ISELEMENTOF&quot;: &quot;&quot; } 4.3.5.2 Internal Module Inputs Package Module Outputs Description VESyntheticFirms CreateBaseSyntheticFirms naics The six digit naics code VESyntheticFirms CreateBaseSyntheticFirms esizecat The employment size category VESyntheticFirms CreateBaseSyntheticFirms numbus The number of businesses VESyntheticFirms CreateBaseSyntheticFirms emp The number of employees in a business 4.3.5.3 Module Outputs naics: The six digit naics code esizecat: The employment size category numbus: The number of businesses emp: The number of employees in a business Top Definitions Inputs/Outputs 4.3.6 CalculateBasePlaceTypes Population and employment location characteristics are important variables in the vehicle ownership, travel demand, and accessibility models. There are four place types (urban core, Close-in Community, suburban, and rural and five location categories (residential, commercial, mixed-use, transit-oriented development, and Greenfield). This module utilizes models for households that were developed to estimate location characteristics using National Household Travel Survey data for the base year. Firms are currently allocated randomly to fit the employment allocation inputs since there are no national datasets from which to draw these relationships. 4.3.6.1 User Input Files Population and Jobs by Place Type (bzone_pop_emp_prop.csv): This file contains the distribution of population and employment among the 13 place types for base and future year.

The model is sensitive to household income, population density of the neighborhood where the household resides, number of household vehicles, whether the household owns no vehicles, the levels of public transportation and freeway supplies in the region, the driving age population in the household, the presence of persons over age 65, and whether the neighborhood is characterized by mixed-use development. It also calculates truck and bus Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT). Regional truck VMT is calculated based on changes in the regional household income. As a default, a one-to-one relationship between regional income growth and truck VMT growth is assumed. In other words, a doubling of total regional income would result in a doubling of truck VMT. Bus VMT is calculated from bus revenue miles that are factored up to total vehicle miles to account for miles driven in non-revenue service. 4.3.12.1 User Input Files Emission Rate (model_fuel_co2.csv): The emissions rate file contains information on pump-to-wheels CO2 equivalent emissions by fuel type in grams per mega Joule of fuel energy content.

Auto, and light truck VMT, truck VMT and bus VMT are allocated to freeways, arterials, and other roadways. Truck and bus VMT are allocated based on mode-specific data, and auto and light truck VMT are allocated based on a combination of factors and a model that is sensitive to the relative supplies of freeway and arterial lane miles. System-wide ratios of VMT to lane miles for freeways and arterials are used to allocate VMT to congestion levels using congestion levels defined by the Texas Transportation Institute for the Urban Mobility Report. Each freeway and arterial congestion level is associated with an average trip speed for conditions that do and do not include ITS treatment for incident management on the roadway. Overall average speeds by congestion level are calculated based on input assumptions about the degree of incident management. Speed vs.Â fuel efficiency relationships for light vehicles, trucks, and buses are used to adjust the fleet fuel efficiency averages computed for the region. 4.3.14.1 User Input Files Percent road miles with ITS treatment (azone_its_prop.csv): This file is an estimate of the proportion of road miles that have improvements which reduce incidents through ITS treatments in both the base and future years. Values entered should be between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating that 100% of road miles are treated. The ITS policy measures the effects of incident management supported by ITS. The ITS table is used to inform the congestion model and the travel demand model. The model uses the mean speeds with and without incidents to compute an overall average speed by road type and congestion level providing a simple level of sensitivity to the potential effects of incident management programs on delay and emissions. The ITS treatments are evaluated only on freeways and arterials. The ITS treatments that can be evaluated are those that the analyst considers will reduce non-recurring congestion due to incidents. This policy does not deal with other operational improvements such as signal coordination, or temporary capacity increases such as allowing shoulder use in the peak.

Values entered should be between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating that 100% of road miles are treated. The ITS policy measures the effects of incident management supported by ITS. The ITS table is used to inform the congestion model and the travel demand model. The model uses the mean speeds with and without incidents to compute an overall average speed by road type and congestion level providing a simple level of sensitivity to the potential effects of incident management programs on delay and emissions. The ITS treatments are evaluated only on freeways and arterials. The ITS treatments that can be evaluated are those that the analyst considers will reduce non-recurring congestion due to incidents. This policy does not deal with other operational improvements such as signal coordination, or temporary capacity increases such as allowing shoulder use in the peak.

The file includes one row for bus VMT data and one row for Truck VMT data. It should be noted that it is not necessary to enter values in the PropVmt column for BusVmt as this is calculated using the values in the transportation_supply.csv user input file. The truck VMT proportion (PropVMT column, TruckVMT row) can be obtained from Highway Performance Monitoring System data and local sources or the regional travel demand model if one exists. The proportions of VMT by functional class can be derived from the Federal Highway Cost Allocation Study and data from transit operators. The Federal Highway Cost Allocation Study (Table II-6, 1997 Federal Highway Cost Allocation Study Final Report, Chapter II is used to calculate the average proportion of truck VMT by functional class. Data from transit authorities are used to calculate the proportions of bus VMT by urban area functional class.

This model does not include induced demand as a result of changes in growth that may occur as part of a smart growth scenario because the evidence is limited empirical evidence. 4.3.16.1 User Input Files Auto and transit trips per capita (region_trips_per_cap.csv): This file contains regional averages for auto and transit trips per day for the base year. Auto is the regional average of auto trips per capita, including drive alone and shared ride travel. This data can be derived from the National Household Travel Survey by region or from a local household travel survey or regional travel demand forecasting model. Transit is the regional average of transit trips per capita, including walk and drive access to transit. This data can be derived from the National Transit Database where the annual database contains a service table that has annual transit trip data for each transit operator or from a local household travel survey or regional travel demand forecasting model. Here is a snapshot of the files: Mode Trips Auto 3.2 Transit 0.4 Place type adjustments to travel demand (model_place_type_elasticities.csv): This file contains elasticities for four performance metrics: VMT  Following the estimate of travel demand that incorporates induced demand, an adjustment is made to travel demand that accounts for changes in growth by the place types that are used in the model to describe urban form. These changes are interpreted as changes in design (intersection street density), accessibility (job accessibility by auto), distance to transit (nearest transit stop), density (population density) and diversity (land use mix). The effect on travel demand is determined as changes in VMT by these urban form categories, as shown in the table below. The elasticities that are shown in the table are multiplied by the D values for each place type. The D values are proportion values for each place type that are relative to the regional average, which is set to 1.0. VehicleTrips  The change in the number of vehicle trips is calculated using a set of elasticities from Index 4D Values (2001) that pivots from the current number of vehicle trips per capita based on the scenarios allocation of growth by place type. The elasticities shown in the table are applied to D values, which are proportional values for each place type that are relative to a regional average for that D value that is set to 1.0. The model reports the additional number of trips caused by the growth assumed in the scenario and not the regional total. TransitTrips  The change in the number of transit trips is calculated using a set of elasticities from Index 4D Values (2001) that pivots from the current number of transit trips per capita based on the scenarios allocation of growth by place type. The elasticities shown in the table are applied to D values, which are proportional values for each place type that are relative to a regional average for that D value that is set to 1.0. The model reports the additional number of trips caused by the growth assumed in the scenario and not the regional total. Walking  The elasticities shown in the table are applied to D values, which are proportional values for each place type that are relative to a regional average for that D value that is set to 1.0. The product of the elasticity and D value is applied to the place type growth quantities for the scenario to calculated the percentage increase or decrease in walking for new residents in the region relative to a the current place type distribution.

The average daily VMT for each household can be adjusted based on changes in growth patterns by place type, changes in auto operating cost, changes in road lane miles or transit revenue miles for any scenario. There are also a series of policy assumptions that can contribute to changes in VMT: pricing such as VMT charges or parking pricing, ITS strategies for freeways and arterials, and vanpool, telecommuting, ridesharing, and transit pass programs. All of these will contribute to shifts in travel demand for a given scenario. 4.3.17.1 User Input Files Percentage of employees offered commute options (region_commute_options.csv): This file contains assumptions about the availability and participation in work based travel demand management programs. The policies are ridesharing programs, transit pass programs, telecommuting or alternative work schedule programs, and vanpool programs. For each, the user enters the proportion of workers who participate (the data items with the Participation suffix). For one program, the transit subsidy, the user must also enter the subsidy level in dollars for the TransitSubsidyLevel data item.

In VERPAT, non-motorized vehicles are bicycles, and also electric bicycles, segways, and similar vehicles that are small, light-weight and can travel at bicycle speeds or slightly higher. The parameters are as follows: TargetProp: non-motorized vehicle ownership rate (average ratio of non-motorized vehicles to driver age population) Threshold: single-occupant vehicle (SOV) tour mileage threshold used in the SOV travel proportion model. This is the upper limit for tour lengths that are suitable for reallocation to non-motorized modes. PropSuitable: proportion of SOV travel suitable for non-motorized vehicle travel. This variable describes the proportion of SOV tours within the mileage threshold for which non-motorized vehicles might be substituted. This variable takes into account such factors as weather and trip purpose. The non-motorized vehicle model predicts the ownership and use of non-motorized vehicles (where non-motorized vehicles are bicycles, and also electric bicycles, segways and similar vehicles that are small, light-weight and can travel at bicycle speeds or slightly higher than bicycle speeds). The core concept of the model is that non-motorized vehicle usage will primarily be a substitute for short-distance SOV travel. Therefore, the model estimates the proportion of the household vehicle travel that occurs in short-distance SOV tours. The model determines the maximum potential for household VMT to be diverted to non-motorized vehicles, which is also dependent on the availability of non-motorized vehicles. Note that bike share programs (BSP) serve to increase the availability of non-motorized vehicles and can be taken into account by increasing the TargetProp variable. Use national estimates of non-motorized ownership if regional estimates of non-motorized ownership are not available (unless the region has notably atypical levels of bicycle usage). See Bicycle Ownership in the United States for an analysis of regional differences. Here is a snapshot of the file: DataItem DataValue TargetProp 0.2 Threshold 2 PropSuitable 0.1 Increase in parking cost and supply (marea_parking_growth.csv): This file contains information that allows the effects of policies such as workplace parking charges and cash-out buy-back programs to be tested. The input parameters are as follows and should be entered for both the base and future year: PropWrkPkg: proportion of employees that park at work PropWrkChrgd: proportion of employers that charge for parking PropCashOut: proportion of employment parking that is converted from being free to pay under a cash-out buy-back type of program PrkOthChrgd: proportion of other parking that is not free PkgCost: average daily parking cost. This variable is the average daily parking cost for those who incur a fee to park. If the paid parking varies across the region, then the PkgCost value should reflect the average of those parking fees, but weighted by the supply  so if most in the Center City, then the average will be heavily weighted toward the price in the Center City.

The proportion of employees participating in the ridesharing program is a policy input. This is converted into a proportion of working-age persons by using an assumed labor force participation rate (0.65) to sample working-age persons in households. The ridesharing submodel then computes the anticipated level of VMT reduction resulting from the implementation of ridesharing, based on the place type the household lives in, using the effectiveness values shown in this parameter file. Previous studies have determined that the level of ridesharing participation will be less in the rural and suburban areas, as compared to the more-urban areas. Typically, more people will carpool in the more urbanized areas due to the presence of parking charges, potential difficulties in finding parking, and other disincentives that are typically present in more urbanized areas. Here is a snapshot of the file: ModelGeo Effectiveness Rur 0 Sub 0.05 CIC 0.1 UC 0.15 Travel Demand Management: Transit Fares (model_tdm_transit.csv): The transit fare Travel Demand Management files are parameters for the effectiveness (level of VMT reduction) and fare subsidy values for employer. The subsidized/discounted transit model begins by evaluating the level of participation within the region. Monte Carlo processes are used to identify which households participate in transit pass programs. The proportion of employees participating in this program is a policy input. This is converted into a proportion of working-age persons by using an assumed labor force participation rate (0.65) to sample working-age persons in households. The model then allows the selection of one of four potential subsidy levels (also a policy inputs), which influence the level of VMT reduction based on the level of subsidy applied to the place type. The anticipated level of VMT reduction is then further reduced to account for the proportion of work travel in overall daily travel.

The vanpool program submodel operates by evaluating the likely level of participation. Monte Carlo processes are used to identify which households participate in vanpool programs. The proportion of employees participating in this program is a policy input. This is converted into a proportion of working-age persons by using an assumed labor force participation rate (0.65) to sample working-age persons in households. Those employers that would participate in the program are then categorized into three levels of involvement from low to medium to high. The level of involvement reflects the extent to which an employer would actively facilitate and promote vanpooling. For example, a low level of involvement might represent an employer who organizes only a minimal number of vanpools. The high level of involvement could represent an employer who has an extensive vanpooling program to cover a large number of employees. Based on the level of involvement, the reduction in VMT is estimated on the basis of the values in this file.

The telecommuting or alternative work schedule model first evaluates the likely level of participation throughout the region in terms of telecommuting or alternatively-works schedules. Monte Carlo processes are used to identify which households participate in telecommuting programs. The proportion of employees participating in this program is a policy input. This is converted into a proportion of working-age persons by using an assumed labor force participation rate (0.65) to sample working-age persons in households. The model then determines the type of programs that might be implemented. Three potential alternatives are offered including: 4/40 Schedule: 4 days per week with 40 hours per week 9/80 Schedule: working 4 days every other week with an average of 80 hours over 2 weeks Telecommuting: Workers may work 1 to 2 days a week remotely Once the option has been identified and the level of participation, the estimated VMT is determined on the basis of the parameters in this file.

model estimation of future transportation supply adjusted to policies as the basis of calculations. 4.3.18.1 User Input Files Percent road miles with ITS treatment (azone_its_prop.csv): This file is an estimate of the proportion of road miles that have improvements which reduce incidents through ITS treatments in both the base and future years. Values entered should be between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating that 100% of road miles are treated. The ITS policy measures the effects of incident management supported by ITS. The ITS table is used to inform the congestion model and the travel demand model. The model uses the mean speeds with and without incidents to compute an overall average speed by road type and congestion level providing a simple level of sensitivity to the potential effects of incident management programs on delay and emissions. The ITS treatments are evaluated only on freeways and arterials. The ITS treatments that can be evaluated are those that the analyst considers will reduce non-recurring congestion due to incidents. This policy does not deal with other operational improvements such as signal coordination, or temporary capacity increases such as allowing shoulder use in the peak. Here is a snapshot of the file: Geo Year ITS Multnomah 2005 0 Multnomah 2035 0 Truck and bus vmt (region_truck_bus_vmt.csv): This file contains the regions proportion of VMT by truck and bus as well as the distribution of that VMT across functional classes (freeway, arterial, other). The file includes one row for bus VMT data and one row for Truck VMT data. It should be noted that it is not necessary to enter values in the PropVmt column for BusVmt as this is calculated using the values in the transportation_supply.csv user input file. The truck VMT proportion (PropVMT column, TruckVMT row) can be obtained from Highway Performance Monitoring System data and local sources or the regional travel demand model if one exists. The proportions of VMT by functional class can be derived from the Federal Highway Cost Allocation Study and data from transit operators. The Federal Highway Cost Allocation Study (Table II-6, 1997 Federal Highway Cost Allocation Study Final Report, Chapter II is used to calculate the average proportion of truck VMT by functional class. Data from transit authorities are used to calculate the proportions of bus VMT by urban area functional class.

The parameters are used in the calculations of the transportation costs performance metrics. The source for transit capital, operating costs, and fare revenue is the NTD, and in particular the National Transit Profile which is available on the NTDB website. Costs are available in a variety of index formats, e.g.Â cost per revenue mile or hour; cost per passenger trip is used in VERPAT. The source for highway infrastructure costs is FHWAs Highway Economic Requirements System model, or HERS. Information was obtained from Chapter 6 of the 2005 Technical Report for all US states (FHWA, 2005). Table 8-1 in HERS provides unit costs (per lane mile) for both Rural and Urban highway systems, and distinguishes among three functional classes: interstates, freeways and expressways; other principal arterials; and minor arterials and collectors. Costs estimates are provided for the following improvements: Reconstruction and widening Reconstruct pavement Resurface and widen lanes Resurface pavement Improve shoulders Additional choices are offered to distinguish between adding a lane at normal vs.Â high cost, and also for pavement realignment, also under normal vs.Â high cost conditions. For practical reasons, it was decided to use only new construction (which also includes adding lanes) costs as the basis for the cost estimates, and to ignore the categories of reconstruction, resurfacing, and realignment. These construction costs include right of way, construction, and a small allowance for bridges and support facilities. The infrastructure costs focus only on the urban system, not rural, which also makes it possible to differentiate by three size classes: Small Urban, Small Urbanized, and Large Urbanized. The numbers from HERS are in 2002 dollars; FHWA advises escalation to current dollars using its NHCCI, which is available online at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/nhcci.cfm); the report in VERPAT escalates uses this Index to escalate to 2010 values. The parameter values in this file are average values per lane mile, simplifying the calculations of highway costs to just differentiate investments in freeway vs.Â arterial functional class roads.

Installation This section describes the installation and usage of VERPAT. 4.3.20 Installation of VisionEval and VERPAT VERPAT and the VisionEval framework are implemented in R, a statistical programming language and environment. Both R and VERPAT are open source and freely available. The installation of VERPAT is a two-step process. Install R Install VisionEval and VERPAT These are described in [[Getting Started: Installation and Setup | Getting-Started#installation-and-setup]]. 4.3.21 Running the VERPAT model Once VisionEval and VERPAT have been installed, a directory with sample data for Multnomah County, Oregon will be present at ../VisionEval/sources/models/VERPAT. (Note .. refers to the parent directory of the installation directory). The VERPAT directory serves the dual purposes of providing sample data and serving as a template for local modification to other locations. It contains two subdirectories and several files: The defs directory contains five [[model definition files | VERPAT-Inputs-and-Parameters#model-definition-files]], also described in the Model System Design document. These contain settings that define the model run. The inputs directory contains a number of CSV and JSON files that provide inputs for the modules. Each module specifies what input files it needs. These are described in [[Input Files | VERPAT-Inputs-and-Parameters#input-files]] and in the Model System Design document. To change the conditions in the model, these input files are modified (see Modifying the scenario). The run_model.R file is described in the Model System Design document and consists of calls to the modules that make up the model. To run this file in R, see instructions at [[Getting Started: Running VE Models | Getting-Started#running-ve-models]]. That page describes running VERPAT via both the R console and using VEGUI. The remaining files in the directory are README.md, a brief text file with a link to [Getting Started], and VERPAT.Rproj, a file for use with RStudio (a text editor and integrated development environment for R). 4.3.21.1 Modifying the scenario As described above, the VisionEval/sources/models/VERPAT directory contains sample input files for Multnomah County, Oregon. These can be modified or replaced to investigate the impacts of policy changes or to model a different region. To modify a scenario, the appropriate input files are edited. For example, to increase bicycle usage, the file inputs/region_light_vehicles.csv would be modified in Excel, LibreOffice, or a text editor to change the DataValue of TargetProp from 0.2 to 0.4: The required input files are described in detail in the Model System Design document. 4.3.21.2 Model output The output data are contained in a datastore, which can be either an HDF5 file or a directory of RData files. The datastore is described in detail in the Model System Design document. In this case (below), the datastore is a directory of RData files. It has a hierarchical structure, with directories for each year that the model is run, plus a Global folder for output that is not year specific. The year directories contain subdirectories for each geographic level, each containing RData files. The Global directory contains data that do not vary by model run year such as model parameters or geographic tables. Each of the Rda files contains a single R vector called Dataset with attributes describing the data. 4.3.21.3 Exporting Data to CSV At the end of the model run, a subset of the data are automatically exported from the Datastore to a set of CSV files. These files will be placed in the model directory in a subfolder called outputs. To export data manually, the script located in ../sources/models/export_output_to_csv.R can be modified to suit.

VE-RSPM The main difference between VE-RSPM models and VE-State models is that a number of VE-RSPM inputs are specified at the Bzone level. The Bzones are sub-regional geographies, typically census tracts or block groups. Diagrams are available on the VisionEval wiki for a visual explanation of the VE-RSPM and VE-State geographies. Also, note that Azones are typically counties, and Mareas are metropolitan areas, typically defined by the boundaries of an MPO. The following diagrams show how these two model differ at the early stages. VE-State uses simulation methods to generate land use and housing input in Bzone level. 5.1.1.1 VE-RSPM Structure 5.1.1.2 VE-State Structure Bzone level attributes are required by a number of modules so methods need to be developed for synthesizing a representative set of Bzones and their characteristics from policies and attributes specified at the Azone and Marea levels. Something like this is done in the GreenSTEP model where a likely distribution of neighborhood population density is synthesized from the overall metropolitan area density. Azone level inputs are provided for base year population and area by development type (metropolitan, town, rural), population growth by development type, and the ratio of urban area growth to population growth. From these inputs, average density is calculated by Azone and development type and a model is applied to synthesize a distribution of neighborhood densities from the average density. All of the VE-RSPM modules which assign Bzone characteristics are contained in the VELandUse package. The modules that are developed to synthesize Bzones and their characteristics will be placed in a VESimLandUse package. When a VE-State model is run, the modules in the VESimLandUse package will be run instead of the modules in the VELandUse package. Otherwise the model setup is nearly the same for VE-State and VE-RSPM. The use of the VESimLandUse modules is not be limited to statewide applications however. Users could simulate Bzones in an VE-RSPM-type application that would enable metropolitan area planners to more easily define and model alternative land use scenarios as is done in VE-RPAT (Rapid Policy Analysis Tool) applications. 5.2 Required Bzone Attributes Land use modeling in VE-RSPM is the basis for the land use modeling in VE-State. These modules were designed to produce datasets needed to run the new multi-modal travel model. The multi-modal module requires several activity density, diversity (i.e., activity mixing), and destination accessibility measures that in turn require households and employment to be located at the Bzone level to calculate those measures. In addition, a few multi-modal network and service level measures need to be calculated. Second, locating jobs at the Bzone level allows for the travel demand management (TDM) and parking pricing modules to establish more realistic relationships between policies and the households they would affect. This also allows household workers to be assigned to job sites and that information can be used to translate job site TDM and parking policies back to households. Finally, simulated households are assigned to Bzones. In VE-RSPM a number of single family and multifamily dwelling units are assigned to Bzones as inputs along with the relative income distribution of households in each Bzone. VE-RSPM models the housing choice of each household based on the overall supply of housing of each type in the Azone and the household characteristics. Then the model assigns each household to a Bzone based on the households housing choice and income, and on the relative supplies of housing of the type and household income distribution in the Bzone. The Bzone attributes that need to be synthesized are: Destination accessibility (i.e., accessibility to jobs and housing) measured consistent as it is used in the multi-modal travel model  This information is one of the 5D measured used in the VE-RSPM multi-modal travel model. Since synthetic zones wont have physical locations, it cant be calculated simply from households and employment by zone. Number of households proportional split of dwelling units between single family and multifamily  Number of households and dwelling unit split by Bzone is needed in order to assign households to Bzones. Number of jobs by sector (retail, service, other) is used in calculating several diversity measures used in the RSPM multi-modal travel model. The number of jobs is also used to associate household workers with workplace Bzones Area type and development type  Some practical system of zonal development classification is needed for organizing policy inputs. Policies such as travel demand management policies will be specified by Azone and area type and/or development type. These designations will also be used in the calculation of the design and distance to transit 5D measure categories that are used in the VE-RSPM multi-modal travel model. 5.3 Approach for Synthesizing Bzones and their Attributes The user provides inputs on: Azone proportional split of dwelling units by location type (metropolitan, town and rural) Azone proportional split of workers by job site location types (for example, proportions of rural residents in the Azone who work in rural locations, town locations, or the metropolitan area) Marea proportional split of Marea employment among Azones Total activity  numbers of households and jobs  will determine the number of SimBzones in the Azone. SimBzones will have equal amounts of activity and unequal areas since activity density will vary among SimBzones. An appropriate average SimBzone activity value will be determined through evaluation of the EPA Smart Location Database (SLD). Models will be applied to select a destination accessibility value for each Bzone. For metropolitan type development, the model will create a distribution of destination accessibility values that is consistent with the overall activity density in the metropolitan area. Random sampling from the distribution will be used to assign destination accessibility values to metropolitan SimBzones. Models will also be developed for town and rural types, but more investigation is needed in order to determine their form. Activity density of each SimBzones will be determined as a function of the destination accessibility of each zone (because destination accessibility is a measure of activity density at a larger geographic scale). A model will be estimated from the SLD which creates a distribution of zone densities as a function of destination accessibility. An adjustment process, such as an iterative proportional fitting process (IPF), will be used to adjust densities and destination accessibilities so that the overall activity density of all the zones in a metropolitan area is equal to the input value Further subdivision of the metropolitan area into area types will be done as a function of the destination accessibility and activity density of each zone. Four such area types are proposed: urban core, close in community, and suburban/town, low density/rural. The final typology and the relationship of area types to destination accessibility and activity density will be developed through examination of the SLD dataset. It is envisioned that area types will be defined as fuzzy sets rather than crisp sets. Although some SimBzones may be wholly one type, many SimBzones will have degrees of membership in several types. Using fuzzy sets is a more realistic recognition of the nature of area types and avoids aberrations resulting from threshold effects. The total activity in each SimBzone is split into households and jobs using a model which relates zonal mixing to destination accessibility, activity density, and area type. This model will be specified and estimated based on investigations using the SLD data. It is anticipated that the model will produce distributions of activity splits from which values will be drawn. IPF or some other adjustment process will be used to adjust values so that the aggregation of the splits for all the SimBzones in an Azone is consistent with the Azone inputs. This model will also need to specify the split of land area between households and jobs. Once the number of households is determined for each SimBzone, the split of dwelling units by housing type (single family, multifamily) as a function of activity density. The SLD and census data will be used to develop this model. IPF is be used to fit the distribution of SimBzone values to Azone level control totals. This will allow users to specify Azone ratios as policy inputs. A variant of the VE-RSPM housing model is applied to assign households to housing types and to Bzones. One thing to be worked out is whether the allocation to SimBzones considers household income or not. In VE-RSPM, relative Bzone income distributions are input and these are used in the process of allocating households to Bzones. This enables VE-State users to model general relationships of income to parts of the metropolitan area (e.g., the effect of gentrification in the urban core). Jobs in each SimBzone will be split into numbers of retail, service, and other jobs. The approach for doing this is yet to be determined. SimBzone splits will be constrained so that they total to Azone splits that are inputs. The model will probably be a function of the destination accessibility, employment density, and mixing of households and employment in the SimBzone. The SLD data will be used to develop and estimate this model. Thought will be given as to whether there should be control totals on the mix for a metropolitan area. If so, IPF or some other adjustment process would need to be used to match the totals. Workers will be assigned to SimBzone job sites. How this is done is yet to be determined. It is proposed that an agile development approach be used where the first iteration of the model will be a random assignment of workers to job sites. Other extensions that could be considered if there is time/budget investigation could be done using LEHD data and SLD data to look for relationships between worker residence by area type and worker job site by area type. Relative income could also be considered. Once numbers of households and numbers of jobs by type are assigned to SimBzones, all the remaining density and diversity measures can be calculated. The distance to transit measure is modeled for metropolitan SimBzones as a function of the metropolitan-level transit supply measure and the SimBzone attributes for destination Development type (e.g., residential, employment, mixed, transit-oriented development, greenfield), are assigned to SimBzones based on the density, diversity, and distance to transit measures. These development types, like the area types may be fuzzy sets. The SLD is used to create the development type specifications. The design will enable model users to input Marea goals for the proportional split of development types. The model will adjust the allocation of development types consistent with the goals but constrained to plausible levels. Network design measures used by the VE-RSPM multi-modal travel model (e.g., multi-modal network density, pedestrian network density) will be applied based on inputs related to area and development type. The SLD will be used to identify ranges of values by area and development type. Users will specify in inputs goals relative to these ranges by Azone, development type and area type. The parking pricing, travel demand management, and car service inputs is specified by Azone, area type, and development type. These will then be translated to the SimBzone based on the SimBzone area type and development type. After that is done, the AssignDemandManagement, AssignParkingRestrictions, and AssignCarSvcAvailability modules can run as they currently do. Thought will be given as to how to simplify inputs so that users are not required to provide inputs for every combination of Azone, area type and development type. 5.4 Inputs and Parameters VE-State data inputs are classified into two categories: Inputs and Model Parameters.

Generally speaking, the VE-State inputs are classified into the five following categories: User input model parameters: These are input parameters (model or scenario specific), defined in model_parameters.json, that users should review and modify as needed. Fixed input model parameters: These are input parameters specific to the model, defined in model_parameters.json, that users should not typically modify. User input files: These are input files (model or scenario specific) that users should review and modify as needed. Fixed input files: These are input parameters specific to the model that are fixed.

Details on these data are included in the VESimLandUseData package. The combined dataset contains a number of land use attributes at the US Census block group level. The goal of Bzone synthesis to generate a set of SimBzones in each Azone that reasonably represent block group land use characteristics given the characteristics of the Azone, the Marea that the Azone is a part of, and scenario inputs provided by the user. Many of the models and procedures used in Bzone synthesis pivot from profiles developed from these data sources for specific urbanized areas, as well as more general profiles for different urbanized area population size categories, towns, and rural areas. Using these specific and general profiles enables the simulated Bzones (SimBzones) to better represent the areas being modeled and the variety of conditions found in different states. Following is a listing of the urbanized areas for which profiles have been developed. Note that urbanized areas that cross state lines are split into the individual state components. This is done to facilitate the development of state models and to better reflect the characteristics of the urbanized area characteristics in each state. It is incumbent on the model user to identify the name of the urbanized area profile that will be used for each of the Mareas in the model. This module reads in the names assigned in the marea_uza_profile_names.csv file and checks their validity.

Details on these data are included in the VESimLandUseData package. The combined dataset contains a number of land use attributes at the US Census block group level. The goal of Bzone synthesis to generate a set of SimBzones in each Azone that reasonably represent block group land use characteristics given the characteristics of the Azone, the Marea that the Azone is a part of, and scenario inputs provided by the user. Many of the models and procedures used in Bzone synthesis pivot from profiles developed from these data sources for specific urbanized areas, as well as more general profiles for different urbanized area population size categories, towns, and rural areas. Using these specific and general profiles enables the simulated Bzones (SimBzones) to better represent the areas being modeled and the variety of conditions found in different states. The documentation for the Initialize module has a listing of urbanized area profile names. The models and procedures in this module create SimBzones within each Azone that simulate the land use characteristics of neighborhoods likely to be found in the Azone. The SimBzones are assigned quantities of households and jobs and are attributed with several land use measures in the process. The characteristics are: Location Type: Identification of whether the SimBzone is located in an urbanized area, a town (i.e.Â an urban-type area that is not large enough to be urbanized), rural (i.e.Â dispersed low-density development) Households: Number of households in each SimBzone Employment: Number of jobs in each SimBzone Activity Density: Number of households and jobs per acre Land Use Diversity: Measures of the degree of mixing of households and jobs Destination Accessibility: Measures of proximity to households and jobs Area Type and Development Type: Categories which describe the relative urban nature of the SimBzone (area type) and the character of development in the SimBzone (development type).

The limit for each household is calculated in several steps. First, the proportion of the households income that may be spent on vehicle operating costs is calculated using a model that is explained below. This is called the budget proportion. Then an adjusted household income for budget calculation purposes is calculated by adding the annual cost of insurance for households subscribing to payd-as-you-drive (PAYD) insurance, cash-out parking payments for workers who work at an employer that has cash-out-buy-back parking, and any vehicle ownership cost savings for households that substitute high level car service for one or more household vehicles. The adjusted household income is muliplied by the budget proportion and divided by the average vehicle operating cost per mile for the household to determine the maximum household DVMT that fits within the household budget. The household DVMT is then set at the lesser of this budget maximum or the modeled household DVMT. The budget proportion model is estimated using data from the Bureau of Labors consumer expenditure survey for the years from 2003 to 2015. The data used are the nominal dollar expenditures by household income category and year by transportation category. The values for the operating cost categories (gas and oil, and maintenance and repair) are summed and then divided by the midpoint value for each income category to calculate the budget proportion for each income group and each year. From this the mean value is computed for each income group. The budget proportions for each income group and year are divided by the mean values by income group to normalize values. The standard deviation for the combined normalized values is computed and value of 3 deviations above the mean is set as the maximum normalized value. The mean values by income group are multiplied by this normalized maximum to derive a budget proportion maximum by income group. A smoothed splines model of the budget proportion as a function of income is then estimated from the calculated budget proportion maximums. This model is used to calculate the budget proportion for a household based on the household income. The minimum and maximum values of the calculated budget proportion maximums are used as constraints to avoid unreasonable results for very low incomes and very high incomes. 5.5.35.1 User Input Files This module does not have user-supplied input files 5.5.35.2 Internal Module Inputs Package Module Outputs Description VESimHouseholds CreateHouseholds HhId Household id VESimHouseholds CreateHouseholds HHSize Number of persons in the household VESimHouseholds PredictIncome Income Total annual income of household VELandUse AssignLocTypes LocType Location type (Urban, Town, Rural) of the place where the household resides VETravelPerformance CalculateVehicleOperatingCost AveVehCostPM Average out-of-pocket cost in dollars per mile of vehicle travel VEHouseholdVehicles AdjustVehicleOwnership OwnCostSavings Annual vehicle ownership cost (depreciation, finance, insurance, taxes) savings in dollars resulting from substituting the use of car services for a household vehicle VEHouseholdVehicles CalculateVehicleOwnCost HasPaydIns Identifies whether household has pay-as-you-drive insurance for vehicles: 1 = Yes, 0 = no VETravelPerformance CalculateVehicleOperatingCost AveGPM Average gasoline equivalent gallons per mile of household vehicle travel VETravelPerformance CalculateVehicleOperatingCost AveKWHPM Average kilowatt-hours per mile of household vehicle travel VETravelPerformance CalculateVehicleOperatingCost AveCO2ePM Average grams of carbon-dioxide equivalents produced per mile of household vehicle travel VELandUse AssignParkingRestrictions ParkingCost Daily cost for long-term parking (e.g.Â paid on monthly basis) VELandUse AssignParkingRestrictions IsCashOut Is worker paid parking in cash-out-buy-back program: 1 = yes, 0 = no VELandUse AssignParkingRestrictions PaysForParking Does worker pay for parking: 1 = yes, 0 = no VEHouseholdVehicles CalculateVehicleOwnCost InsCost Annual vehicle insurance cost in dollars 5.5.35.3 Module Outputs Dvmt: Average daily vehicle miles traveled by the household in autos or light trucks UrbanHhDvmt: Average daily vehicle miles traveled in autos or light trucks by households residing in the urbanized portion of the Marea RuralHhDvmt: Average daily vehicle miles traveled in autos or light trucks by households residing in the non-urbanized portion of the Marea DailyGGE: Gasoline equivalent gallons consumed per day by household vehicle travel DailyKWH: Kilowatt-hours consumed per day by household vehicle travel DailyCO2e: Grams of carbon-dioxide equivalents produced per day by household vehicle travel WalkTrips: Average number of walk trips per year by household members BikeTrips: Average number of bicycle trips per year by household members TransitTrips: Average number of public transit trips per year by household members VehicleTrips: Average number of vehicle trips per day by household members Top ___ 5.5.36 BalanceRoadCostsAndRevenues This module calculates an extra mileage tax ($ per vehicle mile traveled) for household vehicles needed to make up any difference in the cost of constructing, maintaining, and operating roadways and the revenues from fuel, VMT, and congestion taxes. #### User Input Files 1.

Both R and VisionEval are open source and freely available. For running VE-State you need to follow these steps: Install R (users are encouraged to also install RStudio, a free and open-source integrated development environment for R) Install VisionEval Run VE-State The VisionEval installer is available here. Follow the instructions on this page carefully to install the VisionEval on your system. 5.8 In Brief: Running VE-State Base Scenario See the VisionEval Getting Started documentation for an overview of the framework methods for running models and querying results. Double-click VisionEval.Rproj in the location where you installed VisionEval. This will launch RStudio. Enter statemod &lt;- openModel('VE-State') Enter statemod$run() 5.9 In Detail: Running VE-State Base Scenario 5.9.1 Preparing inputs Once VisionEval and VE-State have been installed, a directory with sample data will be available at ../models/VE-State/. (Note .. refers to the parent directory of the unzipped installer file). The VE-State directory serves the dual purposes of providing sample data and serving as a template for local modification to other locations. The ../models/VE-State/ directory contains sample input files for Oregon. These inputs can be modified or replaced to investigate the impacts of policy changes or to model a different state. The folder contains multiple files and subfolders: run_model.R is the core script for running the model. It consists of calls to the modules that make up the model. The user may modify the script to call the desired modules. The defs directory contains five model definition files which is introduced in Model Definition Files The inputs directory contains a number of CSV and JSON files that provide inputs for the modules. Each module specifies what input files it needs. If you would like to know the description of each input file and how you can change those files for your desired testing see Inputs_and_Parameters The ../models/VE-State directory contains sample input files for state of Oregon. These can be modified or replaced to investigate the impacts of policy changes or to model a different state. 5.9.2 Running the Model There are multiple ways to run VisionEval models. VisionEval models can be run via the command line directly or using openModel, and can be run for one scenario or multiple scenarios in parallel. Results can be viewed in tabular form or with the interactive VEScenarioViewer. Start R (or RStudio) and make sure your directory is set to the installer folder. The easiest way to do this is to double-click VisionEval.Rproj, which will be associated with RStudio if that is installed correctly. You should see Welcome to VisionEval! on the RStudio console. Then run the following commands: statemod &lt;- openModel(&#39;VE-State&#39;) statemod$run() By default this will run the model in ../models/VE-State/ directory. The default model is for Oregon, for 2010 and 2040. After running the script you will see how the modules will be running in order. The model run will take approximately 45 minutes. Once complete, the output are exported to ../models/VE-State/outputs in 3 different zone levels. 5.10 Querying results To extract all results to .csv files, run: statemod$extract() On the R console, you will see messages about what tables are being extracted and where the files are being saved, e.g.: Extracting data for Table Azone in Group 2010 Extracting data for Table Bzone in Group 2010 Extracting data for Table Household in Group 2010 [...] Write output file: /models/VE-State/output/Azone_2010_1_2021-03-02_153010.csv Write output file: /models/VE-State/output/Bzone_2010_1_2021-03-02_153010.csv [...] For a state-wide model, the Household and Vehicle tables in particular can be quite large, and this full result extraction might take several minutes. To extract just one field, for example DVMT at the household level for 2010 and 2040, first select just the Household table using the tablesSelected method: statemod$tablesSelected &lt;- &#39;Household&#39; Then select the Dvmt field: statemod$fieldsSelected &lt;- &#39;Dvmt&#39; Extract the result to a list of data frames for plotting, rather than to a .csv file. Some manipulation of the list can be done to put the fields in one data frame for plotting, for example: hh_dvmt &lt;- statemod$extract(saveTo = F) hh_dvmt &lt;- unlist(hh_dvmt) year &lt;- names(hh_dvmt) year &lt;- ifelse(grepl(&#39;2010&#39;, year), &#39;2010&#39;, &#39;2040&#39;) hh_dvmt &lt;- data.frame(year, Dvmt = hh_dvmt) Plot using the ggplot2 library, for example: ggplot(hh_dvmt, aes(x = Dvmt, fill = year)) + geom_histogram() + ylab(&#39;Number of Households&#39;) + ggtitle(&#39;Distribution of DVMT by VE-State for Oregon&#39;) Other query methods are described in the Getting Started documentation. 5.10.1 Scenarios To modify a scenario, the appropriate input files are edited. For example, to change the flat rate tax of vehicles for future azone_hh_veh_own_taxes.csv would be modified in Excel, LibreOffice, OpenOffice, or a text editor to change the VehOwnFlatRateFee of year 2038.

(Note .. refers to the parent directory of the unzipped installer file). The VE-State directory serves the dual purposes of providing sample data and serving as a template for local modification to other locations. The ../models/VE-State/ directory contains sample input files for Oregon. These inputs can be modified or replaced to investigate the impacts of policy changes or to model a different state. The folder contains multiple files and subfolders: run_model.R is the core script for running the model. It consists of calls to the modules that make up the model. The user may modify the script to call the desired modules. The defs directory contains five model definition files which is introduced in Model Definition Files The inputs directory contains a number of CSV and JSON files that provide inputs for the modules. Each module specifies what input files it needs. If you would like to know the description of each input file and how you can change those files for your desired testing see Inputs_and_Parameters The ../models/VE-State directory contains sample input files for state of Oregon. These can be modified or replaced to investigate the impacts of policy changes or to model a different state. 5.14.2 Running the Model There are multiple ways to run VisionEval models. VisionEval models can be run via the command line directly or using openModel, and can be run for one scenario or multiple scenarios in parallel. Results can be viewed in tabular form or with the interactive VEScenarioViewer. Start R (or RStudio) and make sure your directory is set to the installer folder. The easiest way to do this is to double-click VisionEval.Rproj, which will be associated with RStudio if that is installed correctly. You should see Welcome to VisionEval! on the RStudio console. Then run the following commands: statemod &lt;- openModel(&#39;VE-State&#39;) statemod$run() By default this will run the model in ../models/VE-State/ directory. The default model is for Oregon, for 2010 and 2040. After running the script you will see how the modules will be running in order. The model run will take approximately 45 minutes. Once complete, the output are exported to ../models/VE-State/outputs in 3 different zone levels. 5.15 Querying results To extract all results to .csv files, run: statemod$extract() On the R console, you will see messages about what tables are being extracted and where the files are being saved, e.g.: Extracting data for Table Azone in Group 2010 Extracting data for Table Bzone in Group 2010 Extracting data for Table Household in Group 2010 [...] Write output file: /models/VE-State/output/Azone_2010_1_2021-03-02_153010.csv Write output file: /models/VE-State/output/Bzone_2010_1_2021-03-02_153010.csv [...] For a state-wide model, the Household and Vehicle tables in particular can be quite large, and this full result extraction might take several minutes. To extract just one field, for example DVMT at the household level for 2010 and 2040, first select just the Household table using the tablesSelected method: statemod$tablesSelected &lt;- &#39;Household&#39; Then select the Dvmt field: statemod$fieldsSelected &lt;- &#39;Dvmt&#39; Extract the result to a list of data frames for plotting, rather than to a .csv file. Some manipulation of the list can be done to put the fields in one data frame for plotting, for example: hh_dvmt &lt;- statemod$extract(saveTo = F) hh_dvmt &lt;- unlist(hh_dvmt) year &lt;- names(hh_dvmt) year &lt;- ifelse(grepl(&#39;2010&#39;, year), &#39;2010&#39;, &#39;2040&#39;) hh_dvmt &lt;- data.frame(year, Dvmt = hh_dvmt) Plot using the ggplot2 library, for example: ggplot(hh_dvmt, aes(x = Dvmt, fill = year)) + geom_histogram() + ylab(&#39;Number of Households&#39;) + ggtitle(&#39;Distribution of DVMT by VE-State for Oregon&#39;) Other query methods are described in the Getting Started documentation. 5.15.1 Scenarios To modify a scenario, the appropriate input files are edited. For example, to change the flat rate tax of vehicles for future azone_hh_veh_own_taxes.csv would be modified in Excel, LibreOffice, OpenOffice, or a text editor to change the VehOwnFlatRateFee of year 2038.
